Budget 2006-2007
Speech of
P. Chidambaram
Minister of Finance
February 28, 2006
Mr. Speaker, Sir
It is my privilege to present the Budget for the year 2006-07.
I AN OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMY
2. Twenty months ago, when I presented the first Budget of the UPA
Government, I asked Honourable Members – and the people of this country – to
walk with us on the path of honour and courage. The final report card on the first
year of the UPA Government is out, and there are reasons to celebrate. According
to the Central Statistical Organization (CSO), the growth rate in 2004-05 was
7.5 per cent, with the manufacturing sector growing at 8.1 per cent. More
importantly, at current market prices, gross domestic saving increased to 29.1
per cent of GDP and the rate of gross capital formation increased to 30.1 per cent
of GDP. I have no doubt in my mind that these results were due to the political
message conveyed by the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP);
the perceptive leadership of the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh; the policy
changes made by the Government; and the palpable confidence of the Indian
people that their future is in safe hands.
3. I am happy to report that the prospects for 2005-06 are just as good, if
not better. This year can be characterized as the best of times and the worst of
times. Nature has not been kind to us. Natural calamities took a heavy toll on
human lives besides causing extensive damage to crops, roads, houses, and the
infrastructure. Government provided immediate interim relief; this was followed
by releases from the CRF and NCCF totalling Rs. 5145.37 crore to date.
Obviously, this assistance will not be enough. The Planning Commission will
draw up a programme for rebuilding the damaged infrastructure, and I wish to
assure the House that the Government will provide the money for rehabilitation
and reconstruction.
4. It was also the best of times. Government has been able to fulfil the first
NCMP obligation of ensuring a high growth rate. According to the CSO’s advance
2
estimates, GDP growth is likely to be 8.1 per cent this year, with the manufacturing
sector expected to grow at 9.4 per cent. Agricultural growth has bounced back to
2.3 per cent and, barring mining, all other sectors are performing satisfactorily.
Inflation, as on February 11, 2006 was 4.02 per cent. Non-food credit is growing
by over 25 per cent. A large part of the credit goes to our farmers, workers,
service providers, traders and business persons, and I would urge the House to
join me in saluting them.
5. The assault on poverty and unemployment continues. I believe that growth
is the best antidote to poverty. The GDP growth target for the Tenth Plan was set
at 8 per cent. Thanks to three years of 7.5 per cent plus growth, it is possible that
the overall growth rate will be 7 per cent. In recent speeches, the Prime Minister
has raised the bar to 10 per cent, and the Government is determined to take the
country to that high growth path. Growth will be our mount; equity will be our
companion; and social justice will be our destination.
II IMPLEMENTING THE NCMP MANDATE
6. Our success this year is due to our unrelenting emphasis on fiscal prudence
through enhanced revenues and expenditure control, monetary stability and
management of the external debt. However, our success should not tempt us to
stray from this path, and we shall not do so.
7. One of the important NCMP obligations was to focus on agriculture: we
have done so, and the output of food grains is expected to be 209.3 million
tonnes, which is about 5 million tonnes more than in the previous year.
8. The NCMP mandates the Government to promote employment: while
creating permanent and quality jobs in the productive sectors, for providing
immediate relief to the poor, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
was launched on February 2, 2006. In the current year, under a clutch of schemes
including the Food for Work programme, a sum of Rs.11,700 crore is expected
to be spent on rural employment.
9. The NCMP mandates the Government to enhance investment: the
investment rate has increased steadily from 25.3 per cent in 2002-03 to 30.1 per
cent in 2004-05. Several indicators point to continued buoyancy of capital
formation in the economy.
10. The NCMP also mandates the Government to augment infrastructure.
5,083 MW of capacity will be added to power generation in 2005-06, and during
the Tenth Plan period the total addition is estimated at 34,000 MW, which is a
record. Until December, 2005, under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran
Yojana, contracts have been placed for projects spanning 95 districts and covering
41,461 un-electrified and 9,379 electrified villages. Work is on at full steam on
the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) and the North-South, East-West Corridors. As
against 1.86 kms per day completed prior to May, 2004, the schemes are
3
progressing at the rate of 4.48 kms per day. 96 per cent of the GQ will be completed
by June, 2006 and the Corridors will be completed by end 2008. There is also
substantial and visible progress in improving our ports, airports and rural roads.
11. As the year draws to a close, I look back with satisfaction that the promises
we made to the common citizen – the aam admi – have been substantially
redeemed.
III BHARAT NIRMAN
12. I would like to make special mention of Bharat Nirman. It epitomizes the
UPA’s approach to governance. It is a paradigm shift that will enable us to use
the resources thrown up by the engine of growth for building infrastructure and
bringing basic amenities to rural India. Honourable Members are aware of the
six components of Bharat Nirman and the ambitious targets to be achieved by
the year 2009. In the first year of its implementation, 2005-06:
• Rs.944.18 crore has been released so far as grant under the
Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) and the target of
600,000 hectares of irrigation potential is expected to be created
this year.
• Against the physical target of 56,270 habitations, 47,546 habitations
have been covered until January, 2006 under the Accelerated Rural
Water Supply Project (ARWSP)
• 5,337 habitations were connected under the rural roads programme
by September, 2005, and Rs.3,749 crore has been released so far.
• 870,000 rural houses have been constructed and a sum of Rs.2,260
crore has been released till January, 2006.
• The entire allocation for rural electrification of Rs.1,100 crore has
been released and the target of covering 10,366 villages is expected
to be achieved in the current fiscal.
• 17,182 villages have been provided with a telephone till December,
2005 in the first year of the three year programme.
These numbers are a complete answer to those who scoffed at Bharat Nirman.
We are determined to soldier on, and execute the programme in the mission
mode. Since the implementation of Bharat Nirman has gathered pace, I propose
to extend larger budgetary support to the programme. Including the North East
component, as against Rs.12,160 crore provided in the current year, the
corresponding budgetary provision will be Rs.18,696 crore in 2006-07, an increase
of 54 per cent.
IV THE FLAGSHIP PROGRAMMES
13. Let me now present an overview of the Budget. Obviously, the bulk of
4
the resources must go to the UPA Government’s eight flagship programmes:
Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, Mid-day Meal Scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water
Mission, Total Sanitation Campaign, National Rural Health Mission, Integrated
Child Development Services, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
and Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.
14. In 2005-06, Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) for the Plan was Rs.143,497
crore. Of this, support to the Central Plan was Rs.110,385 crore. I propose to
increase both allocations substantially. GBS for 2006-07 has been fixed at
Rs.172,728 crore, representing an increase of 20.4 per cent. Out of this, the
Central Plan will receive a support of Rs.131,285 crore.
15. Education and health will continue to enjoy primacy. For 2006-07, the
allocation for education has been enhanced by 31.5 per cent to Rs.24,115 crore
and for health and family welfare by 22.0 per cent to Rs.12,546 crore.
16. On the eight flagship programmes, the total allocation in 2005-06 was
Rs.34,927 crore. In the ensuing fiscal year, the total allocation will be Rs.50,015
crore, representing an additionality of Rs.15,088 crore or 43.2 per cent.
North Eastern Region (NER)
17. To this, however, we must add the allocation of 10 per cent of the Plan
Budget of each Ministry/Department for schemes and programmes in the North
Eastern Region (NER). For the flagship programmes alone, this would amount
to an additional allocation of Rs.4,870 crore in 2006-07. The total budget
allocation for the NER is Rs.12,041 crore which includes Rs.1,350 crore provided
to the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DONER). From BE
2005-06 to BE 2006-07, the step up is 18 per cent.
Sarva Siksha Abhiyan
18. Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) has recorded remarkable progress in
2005-06 in terms of new schools, additional class rooms and additional teachers.
Two independent surveys show that 93 per cent of the children in the age group
6-14 years are in school, and the number of children not in school has come
down to about one crore. Recognizing good performance, I propose to increase
the outlay for SSA from Rs.7,156 crore to Rs.10,041 crore in 2006-07. 500,000
additional class rooms will be constructed and 150,000 more teachers will be
appointed.
19. In 2006-07, we shall transfer Rs.8,746 crore to the Prarambhik Siksha
Kosh from the revenues raised through the education cess.
Mid-day Meal Scheme
20. 12 crore children are now covered under the Mid-day Meal Scheme,
which is the largest school lunch programme in the world. I propose to enhance
the allocation from Rs.3,010 crore to Rs.4,813 crore in 2006-07.
Drinking Water and Sanitation
21. The target for the current year for drinking water supply will be completed,
5
and 56,270 habitations and 140,000 schools will be covered. Apart from non-
coverage, there is the persistent problem of slippage. The strategy to tackle both
includes conservation, better operational management, and water quality
monitoring and capacity building at the village level. The Government will
provide non-recurring assistance of Rs.213 crore in 2006-07 for setting up district-
level water testing laboratories and field-level water testing kits. I propose to
increase the provision for the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission
from Rs.3,645 crore to Rs.4,680 crore next year.
22. I also propose to increase the provision for the Rural Sanitation Campaign
from Rs.630 crore to Rs.720 crore in 2006-07.
National Rural Health Mission
23. The National Rural Health Mission was launched on April 12, 2005. I
am confident that in 2006-07 more than 200,000 Associated Social Health
Activists (ASHA) will be fully functional and over 1,000 block level community
health centres will provide round the clock services. I have increased the allocation
for NRHM from Rs.6,553 crore to Rs.8,207 crore for the next year.
24. The WHO standard defining ‘elimination of leprosy’ is one case per
10,000 population. I am happy to announce that the goal of eliminating leprosy
was reached in December, 2005. Continuing the vigorous immunization
programme, we hope to eliminate polio too from the country by December, 2007.
Integrated Child Development Services
25. We have expanded the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
scheme and created an additional 188,168 centres. Supplementary nutrition is
the most important component of the scheme. Beginning this year, the Centre is
assisting the States to the extent of 50 per cent of the actual expenditure incurred
for supplementary nutrition or 50 per cent of the cost norms, whichever is less.
The cost to the Centre this year is estimated at Rs.1,500 crore, and I propose to
increase this assistance to Rs.1,700 crore for 2006-07. The total allocation for
ICDS is being increased from Rs.3,315 crore to Rs.4,087 crore.
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
26. I have already referred to the Rural Employment scheme which is
the primary instrument to combat rural unemployment and hunger poverty. For
2006-07, the total allocation for rural employment will be Rs.14,300 crore. Of
this, Rs.11,300 crore (including NER component) will be under the NREG Act
and Rs.3,000 crore (including NER component) will be under SGRY. Since there
is a legal guarantee of employment under the NREG Act, more funds will be
provided according to need.
Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission
27. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission was launched
on December 3, 2005. For the next year, against the estimated outlay of Rs.6,250
crore, I propose to provide a grant of Rs.4,595 crore. Apart from the four projects,
6
including Mumbai metro rail and Bangalore metro rail, mentioned in my Budget
speech last year, the projects under active consideration include projects in
Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.
28. Planned urbanization can act as a spur to growth, employment and a
better quality of life. Government will actively promote the establishment of
new towns, preferably focussed on a specific industry, for example Information
Technology, or a specific theme, for example education or health. Some projects
are on the anvil in West Bengal and Karnataka.
National Social Assistance Programme
29. Old age pensions are granted under the National Social Assistance
Programme (NSAP) to destitute persons above the age of 65 years at Rs.75 per
month. This is woefully inadequate. I propose to increase the pension to Rs.200
per month. I have provided Rs.1,430 crore for 2006-07 and additional funds, if
required, will be provided during the course of the year. I would urge State
Governments to make an equal contribution from their resources so that a destitute
pensioner would get at least Rs.400 per month. I also propose to work with the
Department of Posts and the banks to establish, within two years, a system under
which the pension will be credited directly to the account of the beneficiary in a
post office or a bank.
Women and Children
30. Last year, I introduced a statement highlighting the gender sensitivities
of the budgetary allocations. I was able to cover 10 demands for grants. This
time, I have been able to enlarge the statement on gender budgeting to include
schemes where 100 per cent of the allocation is for the benefit of women as well
as schemes where at least 30 per cent of the allocation is targeted towards women.
The statement now covers 24 demands for grants in 18 Ministries/Departments
and five Union Territories and schemes with an outlay of Rs.28,737 crore.
31. Furthermore, several Ministries and Departments have initiated an
exercise to prepare a public expenditure profile of their budgets from a gender
perspective. 32 Ministries and Departments have set up Gender Budgeting Cells.
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
32. Government is committed to the welfare of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and
Scheduled Tribes (STs). Honourable Members will be happy to know that this
Budget, like last year’s, contains a separate statement on the schemes for the
welfare and development of SCs and STs. On a like to like basis, the allocations
for schemes benefiting only SCs and STs have been enhanced by 14.5 per cent to
Rs.2,902 crore and the allocations for schemes with at least 20 per cent allocation
for SCs and STs have been enhanced by 13.9 per cent to Rs.9,690 crore.
33. The equity contribution to the National SC Finance and Development
Corporation is being increased to Rs.37 crore and to the National Safai Karamchari
Finance and Development Corporation to Rs.80 crore in 2006-07.
7
Minorities
34. I propose to extend greater financial support to the organizations actively
involved in the welfare of the minorities. Accordingly, I intend to double the
corpus fund of the Maulana Azad Educational Foundation to Rs.200 crore.
35. I propose to contribute Rs.16.47 crore to strengthen the equity base of
the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation. In line with the
Prime Minister’s announcement on August 15, 2005, the Corporation will
intensify its efforts to reach out to artisans and weavers living in urban and peri-
urban centres, especially in districts with concentration of minorities. The
programme will focus on skill enhancement, credit and techno-managerial
support.
36. I propose to increase the allocation to the National Council for Promotion
of Urdu Language from Rs.10 crore to Rs.13 crore.
37. Merit-cum-means based scholarships encourage students to pursue higher
studies. Government will finance 20,000 such scholarships to students belonging
to the minority communities. Once the scheme is finalized in 2006-07, I intend
to allocate the necessary funds.
Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme
38. The initial results of the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme
launched in 2004 are encouraging. 1,000 new residential schools for girls from
SC, ST, OBC and minority communities will be opened in 2006-07. I have
provided Rs.128 crore, and I have agreed to provide an additional sum of Rs.172
crore during the year. I propose to provide a further incentive to the girl child
who passes the VIII Standard Examination and enrols in a secondary school. A
sum of Rs.3,000 will be deposited in her name, and she would be entitled to
withdraw it on reaching 18 years of age.
39. Government has shifted the emphasis from sheer ‘quantity’ to the ‘quality’
of the outcome of the various social sector programmes. To ensure value for
public expenditure, an Outcome Budget was presented on August 25, 2005.
Government intends to present a Performance Budget on the first Outcome Budget
before the end of the Budget Session. The Outcome Budget for 2006-07 will be
placed before this House by March 17, 2006. This new approach underscores
our resolve to ensure that the intended services in the right quantity and quality
are delivered to the aam admi.
V INVESTMENT
40. There is an investment boom in the country and it is necessary to maintain
the confidence of investors. It appears that India is catching up with the high
investment rates of East Asia and China. Honourable Members will notice
presently that, in every sector, the attempt is to promote more investment.
8
41. Government is committed to a strong and effective public sector. Public
Sector Enterprises (PSEs) have, through internal and extra-budgetary resources,
investment plans amounting to Rs.122,757 crore in 2006-07. I am happy to
announce that Government will provide equity support of Rs.16,901 crore and
loans of Rs.2,789 crore to Central PSEs (including Railways). Besides, I wish to
point out that in the two years of this Government, we have infused Rs.1,180
crore in cash and made non-cash sacrifices of Rs.2,566 crore to restructure ten
PSEs, including Indian Telephone Industries Limited and Heavy Engineering
Corporation Limited.
42. We believe that there is considerable scope for developing India as a hub
for the gems and jewellery industry. I, therefore, propose to constitute an expert
body that will look into the potential of this sector and the prevalent taxation
practices in India and abroad, and make its recommendations in this behalf. I am
sure this announcement will be welcomed by Non Resident Indians who are
looking to India as the place for future expansion and growth.
43. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) continues to play an important role. We
have the opportunity to make India a manufacturing hub for textiles, automobiles,
steel, metals, petroleum products etc. for the world market. In calendar 2005, up
to November, 2005, FDI is estimated at $ 4 billion, without counting reinvested
earnings and other capital. I am confident that recent policy changes will attract
more foreign investment into the country, especially in infrastructure.
VI AGRICULTURE
44. Let me now turn to the productive sectors of the economy. As always,
our Government’s focus is on agriculture. Assured irrigation, credit, diversification
and creating a market for agricultural products are the thrust areas.
Irrigation
45. Out of an outlay of Rs.4,500 crore under AIBP in 2005-06, the grant
component is Rs.1,680 crore. The States are expected to spend about Rs.2,520
crore from their resources, and 25 projects are expected to be completed before
the end of the year. The outlay for 2006-07 has been increased to Rs.7,121 crore,
and the Central Government will support the programme through a grant of
Rs.2,350 crore. The Ministry of Water Resources will revamp the Command
Area Development Programme to allow participatory irrigation management
through water users’ associations.
46. The programme for repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies is
being implemented through pilot projects in 23 districts in 13 States. The design
of the programme has been finalized in consultation with the States. 20,000
water bodies with a command area of 1.47 million hectares have been identified
in the first phase. The estimated cost is Rs.4,481 crore. The funding pattern
(Centre, States and external assistance) has been finalized, and I intend to seek,
9
and receive, funds from multi-lateral agencies. The participating State
Government will be requested to sign a memorandum of understanding and the
water bodies in that State will be taken up for repair, renovation and restoration
in 2006-07.
Credit
47. Farm credit increased to Rs.125,309 crore in 2004-05 (well above the
target) and is again expected to cross the target of Rs.141,500 crore set for the
current year. I propose to ask the banks to increase the level of credit to Rs.175,000
crore in 2006-07 and also add another 50 lakh farmers to their portfolio. We
shall not only achieve but exceed the target of doubling farm credit in three
years. Since tenant farmers are not adequately served, I have asked the banks to
open a separate window for self-help groups or joint liability groups of tenant
farmers and ensure that a certain proportion of the total credit is extended to
them. I intend to monitor closely progress in this behalf.
48. I am aware of the severe difficulties faced by farmers in the last two
years. Ours is a compassionate Government. I also have severe fiscal constraints.
When faced with a dilemma, I usually turn to my favourite poet-philosopher,
Saint Tiruvalluvar. Writing over 2,000 years ago, he said:
“Karumam Sidhaiyamal Kannoda Vallarku
Urimai Udaithu Iv Ulagu”
(The world is his who does his job
With compassion)
I am prepared to go the extra mile to come to the aid of our farmers. To begin
with, I propose to grant some relief to the farmers who have availed of crop
loans from scheduled commercial banks, RRBs and PACS for Kharif and Rabi
2005-06. Accordingly, an amount equal to two percentage points of the borrower’s
interest liability on the principal amount up to Rs.100,000, will be credited to
his/her bank account before March 31, 2006. I have provided a sum of Rs.1,700
crore for this purpose. I hope the House will welcome this exceptional gesture of
the Government.
49. For our farmers, I have more. Farmers obtain short-term credit from the
cooperative credit structure and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), with refinance
from NABARD. Increasingly, scheduled commercial banks are also lending more
to farmers. It is my intention to ensure that NABARD continues to provide
refinance at an economical rate, so that the farmer ultimately gets the loan at a
reasonable rate. Accordingly, after giving anxious consideration to market
conditions, Government has decided to ensure that the farmer receives short-
term credit at 7 per cent, with an upper limit of Rs.300,000 on the principal
amount. This would require a certain level of subvention to NABARD. I propose
to give the subvention. This policy will come into force with effect from Kharif
2006-07, and I shall make a detailed statement in due course.
10
50. The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) has so far disbursed
funds in 11 tranches. RIDF XI sanctions have touched a level of Rs.7,301 crore
as on January 31, 2006. A special feature this year has been that Rs.346 crore has
been sanctioned to the North Eastern States. This sum is likely to touch Rs.600
crore by the year end. Keeping in view the expanding requirements for creating
rural infrastructure, I propose to increase the corpus of RIDF XII to Rs.10,000
crore, and I urge State Governments to make the best use of these funds.
51. I also propose to allow specified projects under the Public Private
Partnership (PPP) model to access RIDF funds.
52. The rural roads component of Bharat Nirman requires large funds. Hence,
I propose to open a separate window under RIDF XII for rural roads with a
corpus of Rs.4,000 crore during 2006-07.
Agricultural Insurance
53. The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) will be continued
in its present form for Kharif and Rabi 2006-07.
Plantation Sector
54. In continuation of the announcement in the last Budget to introduce a 15
year programme for massive re-plantation and rejuvenation of tea, Ministry of
Commerce has proposed to set up a Special Purpose Tea Fund. While the details
are being worked out, to signal my support to the idea, I propose to make a
levelized contribution every year to the Fund. For 2006-07, the contribution is
expected to be Rs.100 crore. When established, the Fund will benefit growers in
the tea growing States including Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and
Uttaranchal.
Micro Finance
55. I had proposed major initiatives in respect of micro finance in the last
Budget. RBI has since issued guidelines to enable banks to appoint banking
correspondents and banking agents. A window to access ECB funds has also
been opened. A Bill to provide a formal statutory framework for the promotion,
development and regulation of the micro finance sector will be introduced in
this session.
56. The Self Help Group (SHG) movement is making rapid strides. In the
two years of the UPA Government, we have credit-linked 801,000 SHGs. The
credit disbursed to these SHGs is approximately Rs.4,863 crore. I propose to ask
the banking sector to credit-link another 385,000 SHGs in 2006-07. I shall also
ask NABARD to open a separate line of credit for financing farm production
and investment activities through SHGs.
57. The findings of the NSS 59th Round (2003) reveal that out of the total
number of cultivator households only 27 per cent receive credit from formal
sources and 22 per cent from informal sources. The remaining households, mainly
11
small and marginal farmers, have virtually no access to credit. With a view to
bringing more cultivator households within the banking fold, I propose to appoint
a Committee on Financial Inclusion. The Committee will be asked to identify
the reasons for exclusion, and suggest a plan for designing and delivering credit
to every household that seeks credit from lending institutions.
Horticulture and Fisheries
58. The PPP model will be employed to set up model terminal markets in
different parts of the country. A sum of Rs.150 crore has been earmarked for this
purpose in 2006-07 under the National Horticulture Mission. A Central Institute
of Horticulture will be established in Nagaland. The National Fisheries
Development Board will be constituted shortly.
VII MANUFACTURING
Employment
59. The two sectors which have the potential to create a large number of jobs
are manufacturing and services. In manufacturing, we have identified some
industries which, with appropriate incentives, can throw up huge job opportunities.
These include textiles, food processing, petroleum, chemicals and petro-
chemicals, leather, and automobiles. In services, tourism and software can offer
a large number of jobs.
Textiles
60. The last two Budgets have created an enabling environment for the growth
of the textile industry, especially cotton textiles. There has been an encouraging
response to the Technology Upgradation Fund (TUF) scheme. I propose to
enhance the allocation from Rs.435 crore to Rs.535 crore next year. The Scheme
for Integrated Textiles Parks (SITP) was launched in October 2005 with the
intention of creating 25 textile parks. As on date, 7 parks have been sanctioned
and 10 parks have been identified for development. I propose to provide Rs.189
crore for this scheme.
61. Government proposes to launch the Jute Technology Mission in 2006-
07 to harness the potential of the golden fibre. A National Jute Board will be
established. I propose to make a token provision with the assurance that the
funds required will be made available once the outlay is finalized.
Handlooms
62. Several schemes, including schemes for life insurance and health
insurance, were announced in the last Budget for the handloom sector. They are
being implemented. The Cluster Development approach will continue. It is
proposed to cover an additional 100 clusters at a cost of Rs.50 crore in 2006-07.
Yarn depots will be established in different parts of the country to ensure
uninterrupted supply of yarn to weavers. Just as ‘woolmark’ has gained
recognition, it is proposed to launch a ‘handloom’ mark. A scheme similar to
12
TUFS will be introduced for the handloom sector to provide interest subsidy on
term loans. I propose to increase the provision for the handloom sector from
Rs.195 crore to Rs.241 crore next year.
Food Processing Industry
63. Recognizing the enormous benefits that the food processing industry can
bring to agriculture and job creation, and to consumers, food processing will be
treated as a priority sector for bank credit. NABARD will create a separate window
with a corpus of Rs.1,000 crore for refinancing loans to the sector, especially for
agro-processing infrastructure and market development. Government will also
set up the National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and
Management. The Paddy Processing Research Centre at Thanjavur will be
developed into a national-level institute.
Petroleum, Chemicals and Petro-chemicals
64. Petroleum, chemicals and petro-chemicals (PC&P) is a sector with
potential for large investment and employment. In order to promote investment
in this sector, Government has set up a Task Force to facilitate the development
of large PC&P Investment Regions. World class developers and investors are
being associated with the Task Force. It is expected that in 2006-07 at least three
such Investment Regions will be developed.
Information Technology
65. With the spread of Information Technology (IT) and IT Enabled Services
(ITES), the time is ripe to make India a preferred destination for the manufacture
of semi-conductors and other high technology IT products including Wafer;
Assemble, Test and Manufacture of Semi-conductors; Flat LCD/OLED/Plasma
Panel Displays; and Storage Devices. To achieve this goal the Ministry of
Information Technology will announce a policy shortly. I propose to use the
existing vehicles of viability gap funding and the India Infrastructure Finance
Company Limited (IIFCL) to create a window to provide equity participation
and/or viability gap funding to the new ventures. The window will be open for
three years in order to accelerate investment.
Small and Medium Enterprises
66. The introduction of the Small and Medium Enterprises (Development)
Bill and the policy on credit announced on August 10, 2005 have, I believe,
triggered a change in the mindset of small and medium entrepreneurs. The new
thrust is towards up-scaling the size and technological upgradation. After due
consultation with the stakeholders and on the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee, the Ministry of Small Scale Industries has identified 180 items for
dereservation.
67. In order to give a fresh impetus to lending by the Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI), I propose to:
13
• Recognize SMEs in the services sector, and treat the small scale
enterprises in the services sector on par with the small scale
enterprises in the manufacturing sector;
• Raise the corpus of the Credit Guarantee Fund from Rs.1,132 crore
at end-March 2006 to Rs.2,500 crore in five years. In 2006-07, I
propose to provide a sum of Rs.118 crore;
• Advise Credit Guarantee Trust for Small Industries (CGTSI) to
reduce the one time guarantee fee from 2.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent
for all loans; and
• Extend insurance cover to approximately 30,000 borrowers,
identified as chief promoters, under the CGTSI. The sum assured
would be Rs.200,000 per beneficiary and the premium will be paid
by CGTSI.
68. The National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council (NMCC) has
finalized a five-year National Manufacturing Competitiveness Programme. Ten
schemes have been drawn up including schemes for promotion of ICT, mini tool
rooms, design clinics and marketing support for SMEs. Implementation will be
in the PPP model, and financing will be tied up during the course of the next
year.
Cluster Development
69. The Cluster Development model can be usefully adopted not only to
promote manufacturing but also to renew industrial towns and build new industrial
townships. The model is now being implemented, in one form or other, in nine
sectors falling under different Ministries. The sectors include khadi and village
industries, handlooms, handicrafts, textiles, agricultural products and medicinal
plants. It would be advantageous to empower a group to oversee cluster
development and monitor progress. Hence, the Prime Minister has decided to
constitute an Empowered Group of Ministers who will lay down the policy for
cluster development and oversee the implementation.
VIII SERVICES SECTOR
Tourism
70. Foreign tourist arrivals increased to 3.92 million in 2005. It is still a
fraction of India’s potential. During 2006-07, Ministry of Tourism will:
• Take up for development 15 tourist destinations and circuits
following an integrated area development approach;
• Identify 50 villages with core competency in handicrafts, handlooms
and culture, close to existing destinations and circuits, and develop
them for enhancing tourists’ experience; and
• Establish 4 new institutes of hotel management in the States of
Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand and Uttaranchal.
14
I propose to increase the Plan allocation from Rs.786 crore to Rs.830 crore in
2006-07.
Foreign Trade
71. Merchandise exports are growing at the rate of over 18 per cent in the
current year. Imports are high, but they are welcome because they are a sign of
enhanced capital investment and industrial activity. Ministry of Commerce and
Industry and Ministry of Finance have worked together to create an environment
that is supportive of our exporters, and we are determined to double our share in
world exports to 1.5 per cent by the year 2008-09.
IX INFRASTRUCTURE
Telecommunication
72. The telecommunication sector in India is recording one of the fastest
growth rates in the world. Tele-density stood at 11.75 per hundred at end-January,
2006. The ambitious target is to reach 250 million connections by December,
2007, and I am confident of success. I propose to provide Rs.1,500 crore from
the Universal Services Obligation Fund in 2006-07.
73. More than 50 million rural connections will be rolled out in three years
and, thereafter, a connection will be available on demand. The digital divide
between rural India and urban India will be bridged. In order to extend financial
support to infrastructure for cellular telephony in rural areas, the Minister of
Communications will bring a Bill in the Budget session to amend the Indian
Telegraph Act.
Power
74. Power generation in 2005-06 has so far shown a modest growth of 4.7
per cent because of shortage of fuel, mainly LNG and coal. The demand-supply
mismatch continues. More efforts are required to augment capacity in generation,
transmission and distribution. 82 projects are under construction and, when
completed in one to three years, will add 33,000 MW of capacity in the public
sector and 6,500 MW of capacity in the private sector. Of these, about 15,000
MW will come on stream by March 31, 2007.
75. Ministry of Power has invited bids for five ultra mega power projects of
4,000 MW each, of which two will be pit-head (in Chhattisgarh and Madhya
Pradesh) and three will be coastal (in Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra). It is
our intention to award these projects before December 31, 2006.
76. Capacity addition alone is not enough; we need deep and durable reforms
in transmission and distribution. In order to create an enabling and empowered
framework to carry out these reforms, the Prime Minister will establish an
Empowered Committee of Chief Ministers and Power Ministers.
15
77. A target of 3,075 MW of installed capacity for the Tenth Plan was fixed
for non-conventional energy sources, including wind power. By December 31,
2005, that target had been exceeded and 3,650 MW of capacity installed. I propose
to provide a sum of Rs.597 crore next year for non-conventional energy resources.
Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana
78. All States have signed memoranda of understanding to implement the
Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana. 10,000 villages will be electrified
in the current year and, in 2006-07, 40,000 more villages will be electrified. The
key to the success of this programme is the engagement of franchisees and proper
commercial and contractual arrangements for distribution, billing and collection.
Coal
79. A comprehensive review of the coal policy is underway. This year, 45
coal blocks have been allotted for captive consumption to the power, cement
and steel sectors and to the State Governments. After reserving blocks for Coal
India Limited and its subsidiaries for the period up to 2012, it has been decided
to de-block coal reserves of 20 billion tonnes for power projects. The definition
of captive consumption will also be amended to allow coal mining by producers
with firm supply contracts with steel, cement and power companies. The capacity
of Central Mines Planning and Development Institute Limited (CMPDIL) to
drill in order to prove reserves is now only 200,000 metres per annum, and this
will be expanded substantially.
Petroleum
80. Energy security is high on the Government’s agenda. In five rounds of
the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), 110 production sharing contracts
have been awarded. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has now made its
biggest offer under NELP VI. 55 blocks and an area of 355,000 sq kms, which is
thrice as large as the previous round, have been offered. Besides investment in
the upstream and downstream segments, we are encouraging investment in
refining, pipelines and green fuel projects. In the refinery sector alone, an
investment of Rs.22,000 crore is expected in the next few years.
Road Transport
81. The National Highways Development Programme (NHDP) continues to
make impressive progress. The highest ever number and value of contracts were
awarded in calendar 2005. I propose to enhance the Budget support for NHDP
from Rs.9,320 crore to Rs.9,945 crore in 2006-07.
82. A special accelerated road development programme for the North Eastern
region at an estimated cost of Rs.4,618 crore has been approved. For 2006-07, I
propose to provide a sum of Rs.550 crore for this programme.
83. Government has also decided to develop 1,000 kms of access-controlled
Expressways. These will be on new alignment and built on the Design, Build,
16
Finance and Operate (DBFO) model. The sections that have been identified are
Vadodara-Mumbai, Delhi-Chandigarh, Delhi-Jaipur, Delhi-Meerut, Delhi-Agra,
Bangalore-Chennai and Kolkata-Dhanbad. The concessionaires will be selected
through an international competitive bidding process.
84. National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) will be restructured and
made more effective. It will be made into a multi-disciplinary body with the
capacity to handle a large number of PPP projects. New skill areas in planning
and quality assurance, standardization, arbitration, road-safety and R&D will be
created.
Maritime Development
85. Honourable Members are aware that the National Maritime Development
Programme (NMDP) has been approved by the Government. The port sector
alone will require Rs.55,804 crore. Work is in progress in 101 projects covering,
inland waterways, shipping and ports which include deepening of channels in
Kandla, JNPT and Paradip. I propose to increase the Plan allocation for the
Department of Shipping by 37 per cent to Rs.735 crore.
86. A deep draft port is required in the eastern part of the country. I am happy
to announce that it is proposed to carry out a detailed study to identify a suitable
location for a new deep draft port in West Bengal. The existing National Institute
of Port Management, Chennai, has been renamed as the National Maritime
Academy, and it is proposed to upgrade it into a Central University under an Act
of Parliament. The University will have regional campuses at Mumbai, Kolkata
and Visakhapatnam.
87. The India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) has been
incorporated, and the first proposal for funds has been received. Several proposals
have been received for viability gap funding for PPP projects. In-principle
approval has been granted to three road projects in Gujarat and a final decision
is likely to be taken before March 31, 2007.
X FINANCIAL SECTOR
Banking, Insurance and Pensions
88. As part of the reforms in the banking sector introduced in 1993-94, capital
was infused in the banks by issue of special securities. To date, Government has
injected Rs.16,809 crore into nationalised banks. Adding the perpetual securities
issued earlier, the total net capital support stands at Rs.22,808 crore. Thanks to
the capital support, a sound banking sector meeting international norms has
emerged. We have reached a stage when we can wind up the special arrangements
between Government and the banks. Accordingly, after consulting the RBI, I
propose to unwind the special securities through conversion of these non-tradable
special securities into tradable, SLR Government of India dated securities. This
will facilitate increased access of the banks to additional resources for lending to
the productive sectors in the light of the increasing credit needs of the economy.
17
89. Honourable Members are aware that the K.P. Narasimhan Committee
was appointed to recommend a comprehensive law on insurance. The report of
the committee has been received, and is being examined by the Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority and the Government. I intend to introduce
a comprehensive Bill on insurance in 2006-07.
90. Important Bills to amend the banking laws and for setting up the Pension
Fund Regulatory and Development Authority are before Parliament. The Standing
Committee on Finance has recommended these Bills. I would urge Honourable
Members to cooperate with the Government and pass these Bills.
Capital Market
91. In recent months, the capital market has attracted a great deal of attention.
The measures taken in the last year-and-a-half have deepened, broadened and
strengthened the market. It is necessary to take more measures. Hence, I propose
to
• Increase the limit on FII investment in Government securities from
$ 1.75 billion to $ 2 billion and the limit on FII investment in corporate
debt from $ 0.5 billion to $ 1.5 billion;
• To raise the ceiling on aggregate investment by mutual funds in
overseas instruments from $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion and to remove
the requirement of 10 per cent reciprocal share holding;
• To allow a limited number of qualified Indian mutual funds to invest,
cumulatively up to $ 1 billion, in overseas exchange traded funds;
and
• To set up an investor protection fund under the aegis of SEBI, funded
by fines and penalties recovered by SEBI. This will bolster confidence
among retail investors who should be the key drivers of the capital
market.
Consultations have been held in this behalf with RBI and SEBI, who will issue
the guidelines in due course.
92. RBI had introduced the anonymous electronic order matching trading
module called NDS-OM on its Negotiated Dealing System. In the first phase,
RBI-regulated entities, banks and primary dealers were allowed to trade on the
system. The system has now been extended to all insurance entities. In view of
the encouraging response of market participants and to further deepen the
Government securities market, it is proposed to extend access to qualified mutual
funds, provident funds and pension funds.
93. In my Budget speech last year, I had appointed a high-level expert
committee on corporate bonds. The committee has submitted its report and
Government has accepted the recommendations. We shall now take steps to create
a single, unified exchange-traded market for corporate bonds.
18
XI OTHER PROPOSALS
Research and Development
94. Our outstanding human resources have the capacity to make India a
Knowledge Society. Government accords high importance to research and
development. The National Agricultural Innovation Project for research at the
frontiers of agricultural science is expected to receive multilateral assistance
shortly, and will be launched in July, 2006.
95. The National S&T Entrepreneurship Board has set up a number of
Technology Business Incubators with seed funding from the Technology
Development Board. Government will be happy to provide enabling concessions
to the incubatee-entrepreneurs.
Institutions of Excellence
96. Last year, I made a beginning with an unprecedented grant of Rs.100
crore to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore to help develop it into a
world-class institution. I am happy to report that the IISc has obtained approval
for an ambitious programme of modernization, and is implementing the same.
This year, I must recognize another historical event. Three great Universities
have entered their 150th year. These are the University of Calcutta, the University
of Mumbai and the University of Madras. I propose to mark the beginning of
the 150th year celebrations with a grant of Rs.50 crore to each University for a
specified research department or a research programme in that University. On
the conclusion of the year, I intend to make another grant of Rs.50 crore to each
of them.
97. I propose to make the special grant of Rs.100 crore for an institution of
excellence to a distinguished institution, the Punjab Agricultural University,
Ludhiana, in acknowledgement of its pioneering contribution to the green
revolution.
98. If agriculture is an ancient Indian skill, biotechnology is the new frontier
that India will conquer. In order to foster research and development in
biotechnology, the Ministry of Science and Technology has decided to accord
the status of an autonomous National Institute to the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for
Biotechnology, Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala.
Skills Development
99. Honourable Members will recall that Government has taken up a
programme to upgrade 500 ITIs over five years. 100 ITIs are now covered with
the help of the private sector. Assistance has been sought from multilateral
agencies to cover the remaining 400 ITIs. I propose to allocate Rs.97 crore for
this purpose in 2006-07. The Skills Development Initiative (SDI) announced
last year has been taken up through a PPP scheme, and I propose to make an
initial provision of Rs.10 crore.
19
Backward Regions Grant Fund
100. Upon the establishment of a Backward Regions Grant Fund, a sum of
Rs.1,156 crore has been disbursed so far in the current year to the districts
identified as backward as well as under Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana (RSVY).
The Fund is being placed under the administrative control of the Ministry of
Panchayati Raj, and I propose to allocate Rs.5,000 crore in 2006-07.
Jammu and Kashmir
101. Government will continue to provide special assistance to Jammu and
Kashmir. The State Plan for 2006-07 has been fixed at Rs.2,300 crore. In addition,
I propose to provide a sum of Rs.848 crore for the J&K Reconstruction Plan,
including Rs.230 crore for the Baglihar Project. I also propose to provide special
central Plan assistance of Rs.1,300 crore to enable the State to undertake reforms
in the power sector.
Defence Expenditure
102. Government has fulfilled the long-standing need of retired Armed Forces
Personnel Below Officer Rank (PBOR) for better pensionary benefits. About 12
lakh PBOR have benefited to the tune of Rs.460 crore with effect from January
1, 2006, and I am sure the House will welcome this decision.
103. In view of the enhanced expenditure on modernisation of defence forces,
I propose to increase the allocation for defence from Rs. 83,000 crore to Rs.
89,000 crore in 2006-07, and this will include Rs. 37,458 crore for capital
expenditure.
e-Governance
104. The National e-Governance Plan will be approved shortly, and 25 projects,
in mission mode, will be launched in 2006-07. Among them is Project MCA-21
to enable companies to file returns electronically and a project for setting up
common service centres and assigning unique ID to BPL families. It is
Government’s intention to bring a number of services online, in a web-based
mode, including applications under the Right to Information Act, applications
for house sites, ration cards, transfers of teachers, inclusion in the electoral roll,
filing of police complaint, and issue of birth/death certificates and copies of land
records.
Celebrating History and Heritage
105. In 2007, we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of the First War of Indian
Independence, an event that shaped the destiny of the nation. To ensure that the
event is observed in a befitting manner, I propose to make a provision of Rs.10
crore for preparatory activities.
106. Two Gandhian institutions, the National Gandhi Museum, Rajghat and
the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund, Indore deserve support. I intend
to provide Rs.5 crore each to the corpus of these institutions in 2006-07.
20
107. I am happy to inform the House that Kuttiyattam, Vedic Chanting and
Ramlila have been declared ‘Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity’ by the
UNESCO. These old art forms and oral traditions need to be safeguarded. Pending
drawing up a detailed scheme, I propose to make an initial provision of Rs.5
crore in 2006-07.
XII FISCAL CONSOLIDATION
Twelfth Finance Commission
108. The recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) are
being implemented. Cumulatively, State loans amounting to Rs.103,710 crore
have been consolidated so far. Under the new scheme of tax devolution, Rs.94,402
crore will be released as the States’ share in the current year compared to Rs.78,595
crore in 2004-05. As regards grants-in-aid, the amounts granted in 2004-05 and
2005-06 (RE) are Rs.12,081 crore and Rs.25,134 crore respectively. In 2006-07,
both the tax devolution and the grants will be substantially higher. The States
have never been so well provided, as you will find from the Budget papers.
109. I may add that I have made appropriate provision in the Budget for debt
consolidation and relief. I have also provided Rs.3,000 crore towards
compensation for VAT losses, if any, in 2006-07.
Subsidies
110. The issue of subsidies is proving to be a divisive one, but I would urge
Honourable Members that it is imperative that we make progress on this front if
we are serious about targeting subsidies at the poor and the truly needy. My
Ministry has held extensive discussions with stakeholders on three major
subsidies, namely, food, fertilizer and petroleum. We have also sought the views
of the general public. Working groups/committees have gone into the question
of fertilizer and petroleum subsidies, the latest being the Dr. C. Rangarajan
Committee. I would urge Members to help the Government evolve a consensus
on the issue of subsidies.
Gross Budgetary Support and Gross Fiscal Deficit
111. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to draw your attention to two path
breaking developments on the fiscal front. Firstly, the strategy of enhanced
revenue mobilization through reasonable rates, better compliance and widening
of the tax base is yielding tangible results. For the Centre, the gross tax-GDP
ratio, after rising from 9.2 per cent in 2003-04 to 9.8 per cent in 2004-05, has
increased further to 10.5 per cent in 2005-06 (RE). Government estimates that,
through better tax administration, it will increase to 11.2 per cent in 2006-07(BE).
112. Secondly, the year 2004-05, for which the actuals are available, has proved
to be a turning point. After 20 years, the Gross Fiscal Deficit is less than the
Gross Budgetary Support for Plan in that year. What does this mean? This means
21
that Government is not financing the Plan entirely through borrowing. Whether
this trend continued in 2005-06 will be known only after the actuals are available.
However, in the BE for 2006-07, I have been able to confine the gross fiscal
deficit to a number much smaller than the gross budgetary support for the Plan.
113. Last year, reluctantly, I pressed the ‘pause’ button on fiscal correction. I
had estimated the revenue deficit for 2005-06 at 2.7 per cent and the fiscal deficit
at 4.3 per cent. I am happy to report that I have been proved wrong. We have
improved upon both measures. According to revised estimates, the revenue deficit
for the current year will be only 2.6 per cent and the fiscal deficit will be only 4.1
per cent.
XIII BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 2006-07
114. I turn to the Budget Estimates for the next fiscal.
Plan Expenditure
115. Plan expenditure for 2006-07 is estimated at Rs.172,728 crore, up by
20.4 per cent. As a proportion of total expenditure, Plan expenditure has increased
from 26.6 per cent in 2004-05 to 28.3 per cent in 2005-06 (RE) and further to
30.6 per cent in 2006-07 (BE). This points to the improvement in the quality of
Government expenditure.
Non-Plan Expenditure
116. Non-Plan expenditure in 2006-07 is estimated to be Rs.391,263 crore.
The increase of 5.5 per cent over non-plan expenditure in 2005-06 (BE) is due to
normal growth and is one the smallest in recent years.
Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit
117. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates for 2006-07, the total
expenditure is estimated at Rs.563,991 crore. I estimate total revenue receipts
of the Central Government at Rs.403,465 crore and the revenue expenditure at
Rs.488,192 crore. Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs.84,727
crore which is 2.1 per cent of the GDP. The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs.148,686
crore, which is 3.8 per cent of the GDP. I believe that I have redeemed my
promise that the process of fiscal correction will be resumed in 2006-07.
22
PART-B
XIV TAX PROPOSALS
118. Mr. Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals. In the UPA
Government’s first Budget, and more so in the second, I had attempted significant
tax reforms. The results are encouraging. In 2004-05, gross tax revenues
(provisional actuals) increased by 19.9 per cent over the actuals of the previous
year and, according to Revised Estimates, in 2005-06, they are expected to
increase by 21.4 per cent over the provisional actuals of the previous year. These
figures confirm our belief that we should keep our tax rates moderate and stable.
Indirect Taxes
119. I shall begin with my proposals on indirect taxes. Firstly, customs duties.
120. In line with the Government’s policy of reducing customs duties, I propose
to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 15 per cent to 12.5 per
cent. I believe that we are now only a short distance away from East Asian rates.
121. As the peak rate comes down, there is a need to reduce the duty on raw
materials and intermediates.
122. The duty on primary steel is at 5 per cent. I propose to reduce the duty on
alloy steel and primary and secondary non-ferrous metals from 10 per cent to 7.5
per cent. This will also be the rate of duty for ferro alloys.
123. In 2004-05, in view of the high international prices of steel, I had reduced
the import duty on steel melting scrap to zero. With prices of steel coming down,
I propose to restore the duty to 5 per cent and bring it on par with primary steel.
124. The duty on mineral products is now 15 per cent. I propose to reduce it to
5 per cent, with a few exceptions.
125. I also propose to reduce the duty on ores and concentrates from 5 per
cent to 2 per cent.
126. Refractories attract a duty of 10 per cent. A number of materials required
for manufacture of refractories are also at 10 per cent or higher rates. I propose
to reduce these duties to 7.5 per cent.
127. Basic inorganic chemicals are crucial raw materials. I propose to reduce
the duty from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. On basic cyclic and acyclic hydrocarbons
and their derivatives, I propose to bring down the rate to 5 per cent. I also propose
to reduce the duty on catalysts from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
128. Plastics are important raw materials. Hence, I propose to reduce the duty
on major bulk plastics like PVC, LDPE and PP from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
Simultaneously, the duty on naptha for plastics will be reduced to nil.
129. I propose to reduce the duty on styrene, EDC and VCM which are raw
materials for plastics to 2 per cent.
23
130. I propose to give some concessions to vital drugs. I propose to reduce the
customs duty on 10 anti-AIDS and 14 anti-cancer drugs to 5 per cent. I also
propose to reduce the duty on certain life saving drugs, kits and equipment from
15 per cent to 5 per cent. These drugs will also be exempt from excise duty and
countervailing duty (CVD).
131. Packaging machines serve a wide variety of industries, including food
processing. I propose to reduce the duty on packaging machines from 15 per
cent to 5 per cent.
132. I propose to extend the concessional project rate of 10 per cent to pipeline
projects for transportation of natural gas, crude petroleum and petroleum products.
133. Honourable Members would recall that last year I had taken the power to
impose a CVD on all imports to compensate for State level taxes. This levy was
applied only to imports of ITA bound items and their inputs, except IT software.
After the introduction of VAT in most States, I have received representations
from trade and industry that this levy should be extended to all imports. The
argument is persuasive, and I propose to impose a CVD of 4 per cent on all
imports with a few exceptions. Full credit of this duty will be allowed to
manufacturers of excisable goods.
134. In order to protect the domestic vanaspati industry, I propose to increase
the customs duty on vanaspati to 80 per cent, the rate applicable to crude palm
oil.
135. Export oriented units (EOUs) are allowed to clear their goods to the
Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) at a concessional rate. With declining import duties,
DTA units and EOUs should have a level playing field as regards excise duty or
CVD. Hence, I propose to adjust the duty rates on clearances by EOUs to the
DTA at 25 per cent of basic customs duty plus excise duty on like goods. This
will still give the EOU a tariff advantage or, at any rate, in most cases, it will be
on par with a DTA unit.
136. Finally, I have an important proposal that involves both excise and customs
duties. Cotton textile industry has greatly benefited from the relief granted two
years ago. The man-made textile industry is a growth- and employment-driver. It
deserves encouragement. Hence, I propose to reduce the excise duty on all man-
made fibre yarn and filament yarn from 16 per cent to 8 per cent. Simultaneously,
I propose to reduce the import duty on all man-made fibres and yarns from 15
per cent to 10 per cent. Consequently, the import duty on raw materials such as
DMT, PTA and MEG will also be reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. The
import duty on paraxylene is proposed to be reduced to 2 per cent.
137. I have a few proposals on the excise side. I reiterate that it is our intention
to converge all rates at the CENVAT rate which is now at 16 per cent. There are
only two items – aerated drinks and cars – that still attract the higher rate of 24
per cent. I propose to correct this substantially. I propose to reduce the excise
24
duty on aerated drinks to 16 per cent. On cars, I propose to reduce the excise
duty to 16 per cent, but only for small cars. A small car, for this purpose, will
mean a car of length not exceeding 4,000 mm and with an engine capacity not
exceeding 1,500 cc for diesel cars and not exceeding 1,200 cc for petrol cars. I
am confident that industry will seize the opportunity to make India a hub for the
manufacture of small and fuel-efficient cars.
138. I propose to impose an 8 per cent excise duty on packaged software sold
over the counter. Customized software and software packages downloaded from
the internet will be exempt from this levy.
139. I propose to fully exempt from excise duty DVD Drives, Flash Drives
and Combo Drives.
140. Many food items, including packaged items, attract nil excise duty. With
a view to giving a fillip to the food processing industry, I propose to fully exempt
from excise duty condensed milk, ice cream, preparations of meat, fish and poultry,
pectins, pasta and yeast. Excise duty on ready-to-eat packaged foods and instant
food mixes, like dosa and idli mixes, will be reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per
cent.
141. Since leather and footwear are thrust sectors, I propose to exempt from
excise duty two vegetable tanning extracts, namely, quebracho and chestnut.
Footwear carrying a retail sale price up to Rs.250 is already exempt from excise
duty. I propose to reduce excise duty on footwear with a retail sale price between
Rs.250 and Rs.750 from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.
142. At present LPG stoves up to a value of Rs.2,000 attract excise duty of 8
per cent. I propose to extend the concessional rate to all LPG stoves without any
value limit.
143. To promote the use of energy efficient lamps, I propose to reduce the
excise duty on compact fluorescent lamps from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.
144. I propose to remove rate differences between different kinds of tableware
and kitchenware. Consequently, glassware will attract excise duty of 16 per cent
on par with ceramicware and plasticware.
145. Paper finds widespread use in education as well as in packaging. In order
to encourage capacity addition, I propose to reduce excise duty on specified
printing, writing and packing paper from 16 per cent to 12 per cent.
146. Domestically produced petroleum crude is subject to a cess under the
Oil Industries Development Act. The rate of Rs.1,800 per metric tonne was fixed
in 2002. After consulting the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, I propose
to increase the cess to Rs.2,500 per MT. I have been assured that this increase
will be absorbed by the oil producing companies and have no impact on retail
prices of petroleum products.
25
147. There are two requests from trade and industry. I had exempted computers
from excise duty in order to boost the use of computers. That purpose has been
largely served. Domestic manufacturers have sought re-imposition of excise duty
at 12 per cent in order to enable them to take CENVAT credit as well as to face
competition from imports. I propose to accept the request. Since the 12 per cent
excise duty will be eligible for full input tax credit, there should not be any
impact on price.
148. The second request is to impose excise duty on set top boxes. I propose
to accept the request and levy an excise duty of 16 per cent and, at the same time,
reduce the customs duty from 15 per cent to nil. This change will equalize the
duty rates on various types of set top boxes.
149. To round off, I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise the excise
duty on cigarettes. Hence, I propose to increase the excise duty on cigarettes by
about 5 per cent.
150. The bane of excise and customs tariffs is the plethora of exemptions. On
the basis of a comprehensive review, I propose to remove many exemptions that
were granted through notifications. Broadly, exemptions that are end-use based
or have outlived their utility or need certification or give rise to disputes are
being rescinded, with only a few exceptions. The exemption for the SSI sector
will, however, remain unchanged.
151. We have also identified some more notifications which need to be
removed. However, before taking a final view, I propose to put a list of such
notifications on the Ministry’s website and invite comments.
152. This leaves service tax. In 2005-06, the services sector is estimated to
contribute 54 per cent of GDP. Naturally, it should also contribute significantly
to the exchequer. Continuing in the direction followed in the last few years, I
propose to bring more services under the service tax net. The new services to be
covered include ATM operations, maintenance and management; registrars, share
transfer agents and bankers to an issue; sale of space or time, other than in the
print media, for advertisements; sponsorship of events, other than sports events,
by companies; international air travel excluding economy class passengers;
container services on rail, excluding the railway freight charges; business support
services; auctioneering; recovery agents; ship management services; travel on
cruise ships; and public relations management services.
153. I also propose to expand the coverage of certain services now subject to
service tax. I do not wish to burden the House with the details which are available
in the Budget papers.
154. The leasing and hire purchase industry has faced some difficulty owing
to the levy of service tax on all components of payments, including interest. I
propose to rectify the anomaly. Accordingly, interest and instalments of the
principal amount will be abated in calculating the value of the service.
26
155. It is my sense that there is a large consensus that the country should
move towards a national level Goods and Services Tax (GST) that should be
shared between the Centre and the States. I propose that we set April 1, 2010 as
the date for introducing GST. World over, goods and services attract the same
rate of tax. That is the foundation of a GST. People must get used to the idea of
a GST. Hence, we must progressively converge the service tax rate and the
CENVAT rate. I propose to take one step this year and increase the service tax
rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. Let me hasten to add that since service tax
paid can be credited against service tax payable or excise duty payable, the net
impact will be very small.
Direct Taxes
156. I shall now turn to my proposals on direct taxes.
157. The good news is that there will be no change in the rates of personal
income tax or corporate income tax.
158. The other piece of good news is that no new taxes are being imposed.
159. The one-by-six scheme under the Income Tax Act obliging certain
categories of persons to file returns will stand abolished.
160. I propose to marginally revise certain tax rates in the quest for equity.
While the corporate tax rate is 30 per cent, the rate under Minimum Alternate
Tax (MAT) is only 7.5 per cent of book profits. I propose to increase the rate to
10 per cent, which is still only one-third of the normal rate. I also propose to
include long-term capital gains arising out of securities in calculating book profits.
I have already allowed MAT-paying companies to take credit for MAT over five
years. I propose to extend the period to seven years as well as adjust MAT credit
while calculating interest liability.
161. The rates for the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) were fixed when prices
of securities were much lower. Reflecting the increase in implicit capital gains
in securities transactions, I propose an increase of 25 per cent, across the board,
on all rates of STT.
162. Section 80IA of the Income Tax Act applies to infrastructure facilities.
For developing an industrial park the terminal date is March 31, 2006. I propose
to extend the period to March 31, 2009. For the power sector, in view of the ultra
mega projects, I propose to extend the date to March 31, 2010.
163. Last year, I recast the provisions relating to savings. Fixed deposits were
not included. There is a demand that fixed deposits of certain tenure should
qualify for tax exemption. I propose to include investments in fixed deposits in
scheduled banks for a term of not less than five years in section 80C of the
Income Tax Act. I also propose to remove the limit of Rs.10,000 in respect of
contribution to certain pension funds in section 80CCC, subject to the overall
ceiling of Rs.100,000.
27
164. I propose to align the definition of open-ended equity-oriented schemes
of mutual funds in the Income Tax Act with the definition adopted by SEBI. I
also propose to treat open-ended equity-oriented schemes and close-ended equity-
oriented schemes on par for the purpose of exemption from dividend distribution
tax.
165. I have revisited the exemptions in the Income Tax Act. As a result, I
propose to remove the exemption under section 10(23G) which is not relevant
when interest rates are moderate.
166. Cooperative banks, like any other bank, are lending institutions and should
pay tax on their profits. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) and Primary
Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks (PCARDB) stand on a
special footing and will continue to be exempt from tax under section 80P of the
Income Tax Act. However, I propose to exclude all other cooperative banks from
the scope of that section.
167. Section 54EC and section 54ED are tax shelters. I propose to restrict the
scope of section 54EC to two institutions, viz., NHAI and REC. For NABARD,
SIDBI and NHB, which are banks, we have already opened the route of zero
coupon bonds to raise low cost funds. Government will, if needed, provide
appropriate support to these institutions to enable them to access resources to
fulfil their mandate effectively. I also propose to withdraw the benefit of section
54ED, which has become virtually redundant, with effect from April 1, 2006.
168. The Standing Committee on Finance has expressed concern that many
charitable institutions misuse the provisions of the Income Tax Act. I propose to
focus on one misuse, namely, receiving anonymous or pseudonymous donations.
Accordingly, I propose that anonymous or pseudonymous donations to wholly
charitable institutions will be taxed at the highest marginal rate. Such donations
to partly religious and partly charitable institutions/trusts will be taxed only if
the donation is specifically for an educational or medical purpose. However, I
make it clear that such donations to wholly religious institutions and religious
trusts will not be covered by the new provision.
169. Members of State Legislatures have complained that their constituency
allowances are taxed differently from the constituency allowance received by
Members of Parliament. I propose to remove the discrimination and treat them
equally.
170. The Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the Department of Income
Tax is the critical element in capturing incomes and expenditures. Scrutiny of
Annual Information Returns (AIR) on high-value transactions reveals that 60
per cent of the transactions are without quoting PAN. Hence, I propose to take
the power to issue PAN suo motu in certain cases. I also propose to take the
power to direct persons to apply for PAN in certain cases. I propose to notify, in
due course, more transactions for which quoting of PAN will be mandatory. I
also propose to prescribe a few more transactions to be reported in AIRs.
28
171. Last year, I introduced two new taxes. The Banking Cash Transaction
Tax (BCTT) has turned out to be a boon, not for the modest revenues it brought
which was never its purpose, but for the remarkable trails that it has helped
establish. To cite just one example, huge cash withdrawals in a bank branch in
Chandni Chowk, noticed through the BCTT, led the Department of Income Tax
to three entities which were carrying on the business of purchasing demand drafts
from traders at a discount and helping the traders to avoid both sales tax and
income tax. These entities would deposit the demand drafts in their own accounts
and withdraw the cash. In a period of 18 months, they had laundered Rs.1,500
crore. BCTT has also helped the Department to detect bogus bills, accommodation
entries, artificial loss claims and dummy firms. I propose to continue the BCTT
for some more time until the AIR system is able to capture all significant financial
transactions.
172. Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) was introduced as a revenue raising measure.
FBT can be justified on the principles of horizontal equity and vertical equity.
Nevertheless, I have reviewed it with an open mind. I have also taken on board
the views expressed by the apex chambers of commerce. I propose to make the
following changes in chapter XII-H of the Income Tax Act:
• Value the benefit in the form of ‘tour and travel’ at 5 per cent instead
of 20 per cent;
• Value the benefit in the form of ‘hospitality’ and ‘use of hotel boarding
and lodging facilities’, in the case of airline companies and shipping
industry, at 5 per cent instead of 20 per cent;
• Exclude the expenses on free samples of medicines and of medical
equipment distributed to doctors;
• Exclude the expenses incurred on brand ambassador and celebrity
endorsement; and
• Prescribe a threshold of Rs.100,000 under section 115WB(1)(c) so
that only a contribution by an employer to an approved
superannuation fund in excess of Rs.100,000 per year per employee
will attract FBT. Under section 80C there is already an exemption
up to Rs.100,000 for contribution by an employee to an approved
superannuation fund. Honourable Members will note that, under
these two provisions, there can now be a tax-exempt contribution
up to Rs.200,000 per year for the benefit of an employee. This
allowance, I believe, is generous enough in the case of an
overwhelming majority of employees.
With these changes, I am confident that the debate on FBT will draw to a close.
Let me remind everyone concerned once again that FBT is justified on the
principle of equity.
29
Modernizing Tax Administration
173. I am glad to inform the House that technology is being increasingly
employed to modernize tax administration. The Departments of Income Tax and
Customs and Central Excise will undergo Business Process Reengineering (BPR).
Nationwide networks will connect 745 income tax offices in 510 cities and 550
customs and central excise offices in 245 cities, creating national databases.
National data centres, data warehousing facilities and disaster recovery sites are
being set up. Jurisdiction-free filing of returns, online tracking of status of
accounts and refunds of income tax will be possible. Introduction of a risk
management system and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in the Customs
Department will reduce dwell time for cargo. E-payments of customs and excise
duties will be possible. Both Departments will have fully computerised networks
by end 2006.
174. Our Government’s two Budgets have seen many innovations – the Gender
Budget, the Outcome Budget etc. Today, I place before the House another
innovation – a statement on revenue foregone, known worldwide as tax
expenditure statement. This statement captures the departures from the normal
tax regime. This exercise is a first attempt that will be fine tuned in the years to
come.
VAT and CST
175. The House is aware that most States have implemented VAT with effect
from April 1, 2005, and the unanimous opinion is that VAT has been a resounding
success. I hope that the non-VAT States will soon join the mainstream, because
the next stage of reform depends on all States implementing VAT. The Empowered
Committee of State Finance Ministers has recommended that Central Sales Tax
(CST) be phased out, and have requested the Centre to compensate them for the
expected loss of revenue. Government has proposed that the loss of revenue
may be compensated through monetary and non-monetary measures which, taken
together, will ensure that the States’ revenues remain buoyant. Once the
Empowered Committee and the Government reach an agreement, I shall return
to the House with firm proposals, including legislative changes and a
supplementary demand.
176. In the meanwhile, there is an urgent matter connected with CST and VAT
which has to be attended to. It has become imperative to moderate the price of
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) for domestic use. States are taxing LPG
(domestic) at high rates. They should also bear a portion of the burden of high
prices of petroleum products. Hence, in order to moderate the price of LPG
(domestic), I propose to include LPG (domestic) in the list of ‘declared goods’
under the CST Act.
177. My tax proposals on direct taxes are estimated to yield a gain of about
Rs.4,000 crore. On the indirect taxes side, the gain is estimated at Rs.2,000 crore.
30
XV CONCLUSION
178. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that the world has recognized the potential of
India. It is now for us, the generation to which has been given the privilege of
carrying the torch, to rediscover the greatness of this country and the potential of
its people. The young people of India are building castles, it may appear that
those castles are in the air, but as Henry David Thoreau said: “If you have built
castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now
put the foundations under them.” It is our duty to put the foundations on which
the young can build their castles. The UPA Government has pledged itself to
that task.
179. Over a hundred years ago, a restless young man in his quest for the core
of all spirituality admonished his fellow men in the following words: “We reap
what we sow. We are the makers of our own fate. The wind is blowing; those
vessels whose sails are unfurled catch it, and go forward on their way, but those
which have their sails furled do not catch the wind. Is that the fault of the
wind?....... We make our own destiny.” Those are the immortal words of Swami
Vivekananda. Let us believe in our destiny, let us make our future.
180. Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House.

Budget 2004-2005
Speech of
P. Chidambaram
Minister of Finance
July 8, 2004
PART A
Mr. Speaker, Sir.
I. INTRODUCTION
1 . I rise to present the budget for the year 2004-05.
2 . Every five years, or sometimes sooner, the people of India speak in their collective
voice. The message is usually unambiguous and clear. Elections 2004 were no
different. The people’s vote against one coalition – and the vote in favour of another
coalition – was a vote for change. As the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, said
in his address to the Nation two weeks ago, the people have sought “a change in the
manner in which this country is run, a change in national priorities, and a change in
the processes and focus of governance.” I shall make every effort to be true to that
mandate.
II. NATIONAL COMMON MINIMUM PROGRAMME:
THE GUIDING LIGHT
3 . The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) has given to itself, and to the people of
this country, a Common Minimum Programme. The Government has since adopted
it as the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP). The programme spells
out seven clear economic objectives:
(1) maintaining a growth rate of 7 - 8 per cent per year for a sustained period;
(2) providing universal access to quality basic education and health;
(3) generating gainful employment in agriculture, manufacturing and services,
and promoting investment;
(4) assuring 100 days’ employment to the breadwinner in each family at the
minimum wage;
1
2
(5) focusing on agriculture and infrastructure;
(6) accelerating fiscal consolidation and reform; and
(7) ensuring higher and more efficient fiscal devolution.
4 . The UPA government began its journey in May this year. However, I may note
that one-quarter of the year has elapsed and, by the time the Budget is passed and
the President gives his assent to the Finance Bill, nearly one-half of the year will be
over. There is also an Interim Budget left behind by my predecessor.
5 . The Government has to shift gears; and even if we are able to do so quickly, it
would leave us only about six months to achieve our objectives for this year. We
have therefore decided to adopt an innovative approach. The Planning Commission
has advised the ministries and departments to redefine their priorities and redraw
their programmes in accordance with the NCMP. This will necessarily involve some
changes in the allocations under each head of expenditure. Besides, new programmes
or schemes may have to be launched, and old ones restructured. Under the
circumstances, it was considered optimal to allow the ongoing programmes to continue
until the Planning Commission completes an exhaustive review and reorients the
expenditure pattern to conform to the NCMP objectives. One thing, however, is
clear. The Plan resources made available in the Interim Budget will be insufficient.
Hence, in addition to the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) of Rs.135,071 crore provided
in the Interim Budget, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.10,000 crore. This, and
some other additional allocations, will raise total plan expenditure to Rs.145,590
crore in the Budget Estimates for 2004-05.
III. FRBM AND THE MACROECONOMIC BACKDROP
6 . The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) 2003 has
streamlined the Budget presentation process. The Government has demonstrated
its commitment to prudent fiscal and financial policies by notifying the Act and the
Rules with effect from July 5, 2004. Along with the Budget, a medium-term fiscal
policy statement, a fiscal policy strategy statement and a macroeconomic framework
statement are being presented to the House.
7 . Under the FRBM Act, I am obliged to wipe out the revenue deficit by 2007-08.
However, the NCMP has proposed that we do so by 2008-09. In my view, 2008-09 is
a more credible terminal year; it will also coincide with the term of this Government.
Hence, I propose to move an amendment to this effect through the Finance Bill. I
am committed to implementing the FRBM Act. The elimination of revenue deficit
will open up fiscal space up to 3 per cent of GDP for enhanced public investment
without undermining fiscal prudence.
8 . The economic fundamentals appear strong and the balance of payments is robust.
Although there are short term pressures on prices, the outlook for the year is benign
and the Government is fully alert. Growth will be sustained by increased production
and value addition in agriculture, a marked improvement in industrial production,
and continued buoyancy in the performance of the services sector.
9 . The Government will follow a 5-year road map to achieve the NCMP objective of
bringing about rapid growth with stability and equity. Sequencing the measures
3
in an appropriate fashion and continuing the reform process, which ushered in
the era of rapid growth, are the main challenges. The Government is committed to
strike a fine balance among the three mutually reinforcing objectives of growth,
stability and equity.
IV. ASSAULT ON POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT
10. One of our greatest assets is our human resources, our people. Empowering
the people, especially the poor, with universal access to education and health, and
facilitating their full participation in the growth process through gainful employment,
will enhance their welfare. It will also reinforce the growth process itself. This win-
win strategy is the keystone of the economic policy framework of the Government.
Plan reorientation
11. I have the benefit of the wise counsel of the Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan
Singh. In our scheme of things, the poor will have a first charge not only on the
additional sum of Rs.10,000 crore of GBS that I propose to provide today, but also
on the entire Plan funds that the Planning Commission will reallocate.
12. The poor want basic education for their children: we shall provide it, and we
shall make sure that the child remains in school for at least eight years. We shall
also make sure that the child is not hungry while she or he is at school. The poor
want drinking water: we shall ensure that every habitation has an assured source of
drinking water. The poor want basic health care, medicines at fair prices and a
doctor within a reasonable distance: we shall ensure that the public health system
has adequate human and financial resources to provide basic medical care. The
poor want jobs for their children: we shall ensure that through higher investments,
and through targeted intervention, jobs are available to them.
13. While the Planning Commission will make the final allocations, I may assure
the House that crucial programmes such as Food for Work, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan,
Midday Cooked-Meal Scheme, basic health care, railway moderanisation and safety,
Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, drinking water, investment in agriculture,
Provision of Rural amenities in Urban Areas (PURA), roads, and science and
technology, including bio-technology, will receive priority and will be provided with
additional funds.
Antyodaya Anna Yojana
14. I propose to continue, and expand, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana. At present, 1.5
crore families are covered. These families are provided with 35 kg. of foodgrains per
family per month at a highly subsidized price of Rs. 2 per kg. for wheat and Rs.3 per
kg for rice. 20.76 lakh tonnes of rice and 17.48 lakh tonnes of wheat were distributed
under the Scheme in 2003-04. In the current year, I propose to cover 2 crore families.
I expect that the off-take of rice and wheat will increase. Consequently, the Antyodaya
Anna Yojana will receive a subsidy of nearly Rs.3500 crore. A provision for this level of
expenditure has been included in the allocation for food subsidy of Rs.25,800 crore.
Public distribution system
15. Fair price shops constitute the backbone of the food security system for the
poor. We shall address the weaknesses in the system and strengthen public
distribution. I shall return to this subject a little later.
4
Food for Work Programme
16. Investment and growth will create new job opportunities for our young men and
women. Nevertheless, currently there is a need to ensure that unemployment does
not take a heavy toll on the poor people. Work has begun on the National Employment
Guarantee Act. The object is to guarantee 100 days of employment in a year to one
able-bodied person in every poor household. The Bill will take into account the
experience gained in Maharashtra. Government will also take care to avoid the
pitfalls pointed out by responsible critics. My colleague, the Minister of Labour,
expects that he would be able to introduce the Bill in Parliament shortly. Pending
the enactment of the new law, I propose to launch a new Food for Work programme
in 150 districts classified as most backward and identified as areas in immediate
need of such a programme. Allocations under different schemes will be pulled together
to support the Food for Work programme. There are substantial funds totaling over
Rs.6000 crore under SGRY, SGSY, SJSRY, REGP and PMRY. Depending on the
demand for such work, more funds will be allocated in the current year. I expect to
increase the allocations substantially over the next four years. Special care will be
taken in laying down the guidelines for the programme so that the money and labour
expended result in durable and visible assets benefiting the whole community.
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
17. The welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is close to my heart.
The allocation for programmes concerning the Scheduled Castes is Rs.1180 crore
(an increase from Rs.1137 crore) and for Scheduled Tribes is Rs.1146 crore (an
increase from Rs.1087 crore). Other plan schemes such as SGSY, SGRY and IAY
also contain specific reservations for beneficiaries belonging to the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes. The reservations range from 50 per cent to 60 per cent.
Minorities
18. Particular attention will be paid to the welfare, especially education, of the
minorities. Hence, an additional allocation of Rs.50 crore has been made for the
National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation.
Self-help groups
19. Microfinance initiatives are a cost-effective way to take the banking system to
the poor. The Self-Help Group (SHG) – bank linkage programme, initiated in 1992,
has come a long way. Until March 31, 2004, 1.67 crore families had benefited
through 10.79 lakh SHGs financed by banks. While the SHG concept will be promoted
vigorously, I am of the view that matured SHGs may be in a position to graduate
from consumption or production credit to starting micro-enterprises. An indicative
target of credit linking 5.85 lakh SHGs during the period up to March 31, 2007 has
been set for NABARD, SIDBI, banks and other agencies.
V. THRUST AREAS
20. Before I deal with other areas of concern on which the Budget will have an
impact, let me give you a snapshot of the goals that I have set for myself :
♦ Doubling agricultural credit in three years, accelerating the completion of
irrigation projects and investing in rural infrastructure;
5
♦ Providing farm insurance and livestock insurance;
♦ Improving agricultural product markets, and promoting agri-businesses;
♦ Drinking water for all;
♦ Expanding water harvesting, watershed development and minor- irrigation
and micro-irrigation schemes;
♦ Enhancing investment in industry – public and private, domestic and
foreign – to create new jobs;
♦ Creating space for small-scale industry to thrive and grow;
♦ Electricity for all;
♦ Universal access to telecommunication facilities;
♦ More housing for the poor;
♦ Access to medical care through health insurance; and
♦ Encouraging savings, and protecting the savings of senior citizens;
21. I believe that the key to growth is investment – public and private, domestic and
foreign. It is therefore my intention to considerably enhance investment in all sectors
of the economy. However, fiscal prudence and financial discipline will remain the
overarching objective. I shall also take into account the availability of resources and
the absorptive capacity of various sectors.
VI. EDUCATION AND HEALTH
Education
22. In my scheme of things, no issue enjoys a higher priority than providing basic
education to all children. The NCMP mandates Government to levy an education
cess. I propose to levy a cess of 2 per cent. The new cess will yield about Rs.4000 -
5000 crore in a full year. The whole of the amount collected as cess will be earmarked
for education, which will naturally include providing a nutritious cooked midday
meal. If primary education and the nutritious cooked meal scheme can work hand
in hand, I believe there will be a new dawn for the poor children of India.
23. I am concerned about the quality of technical education in the country. Lest I
be misunderstood, I am not referring to the IITs but to the ITIs. ITIs are the training
ground for skilled manpower. The skills imparted by ITIs must keep pace with the
technological demands of industry and the expanding universe of knowledge. There
is only one benchmark for our technicians – and that is the world standard. In order
to produce technicians of world standard, Government proposes to launch a
programme in the Central sector to upgrade 500 ITIs over the next 5 years at the
rate of 100 ITIs a year. Appropriate infrastructure and equipment will be provided,
the syllabi will be upgraded and new trades will be introduced. This is an area
where I welcome Chambers of Commerce and Industry to join hands with the
Government and create a public-private partnership model for designing and
implementing the scheme. The selection of the ITIs will be done in consultation with
the State Governments.
6
24. An education loan scheme has been in operation since April 2001 under which
loans up to Rs.7.50 lakh and Rs.15 lakh are available for professional courses within
the country and abroad, respectively. The requirement of collateral was dispensed
with for loans up to Rs.4 lakh. I am happy to say that commercial banks have now
agreed to waive the need for collateral for loans up to Rs.7.5 lakh, if a satisfactory
guarantee is provided on behalf of the student. Thus, no student admitted to any
professional course, including courses in IITs, IIMs and medical colleges, will be
deprived of the opportunity to study because of lack of funds.
Health
25. Access to medical care is not easily available to the poor. The Universal Health
Insurance Scheme (UHIS) now in operation is skewed in favour of the non-poor. As
a result, only a very small number of families below the poverty line (BPL) – actually
11,408 till May, 2004 – have been covered. Although the premiums are low, BPL
families seem to avoid the scheme due to their inability to pay the premium. In its
present design, the scheme may not be sustainable. I, therefore, propose to redesign
the scheme and make it exclusive for persons and families below the poverty line.
The revised premium would be Rs.165 for individuals, Rs.248 for a family of five and
Rs.330 for a family of seven, without any reduction in benefits. To offset the reduction
in premium, I propose to enhance the premium subsidy from Rs.100 at present to
Rs.200 for an individual, Rs.300 for a family of five and Rs.400 for a family of seven.
The cost to the exchequer will be Rs.40 crore in a full year. If the money is fully
spent, the number insured will rise to about 10 lakh.
26. In addition to the above, I propose to introduce a new Group Health Insurance
Scheme through public sector non-life insurance companies. The insured will be
members of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and other credit linked groups (CLGs) who
avail of loans from banks or cooperative institutions. Under the group health
insurance scheme, the premium will be Rs.120 per person, but the insurance cover
would be for a sum of Rs.10,000.
27. The NCMP also rightly emphasizes the need for an accelerated AIDS control
programme. Bold and determined efforts need to be made to achieve zero-level
growth of HIV/AIDS. These will include improved surveillance through the setting
up of more sentinel sites and use of primary health centres to monitor HIV/AIDS,
public awareness campaigns, promotion of safe sex through the use of condoms,
prevention of drug abuse and distribution of disposable syringes. The allocation for
prevention and control of HIV/AIDS is Rs. 259 crore.
VII. AGRICULTURE AND THE RURAL ECONOMY
28. Boosting agricultural growth through diversification and development of agro-
processing is one of the objectives of the NCMP. The Prime Minister, in his address
to the Nation on June 24, 2004 promised a “New Deal” for rural India. This New
Deal is not only essential for rural development and welfare, but also essential for
achieving sustained overall annual growth of 7-8 per cent and generating employment.
29. The agriculture sector requires massive investments. Such investments have
to be through credit-enabled private investment and enhanced public investment. I
also intend to use fiscal instruments to boost investment in agriculture.
7
Credit
30. It is my intention to double the flow of agricultural credit in three years. We
have made a beginning by announcing a comprehensive policy on agricultural
credit on June 18, 2004. The policy has been received well and will be fine-tuned,
if necessary.
31. Government has entrusted the implementation of the policy to the public sector
and private sector banks, the regional rural banks (RRBs) and the cooperative banks.
32. Each RRB has a sponsor bank. I propose to hold each sponsor bank squarely
accountable for the performance of RRBs under its control. RRBs that adopt a new
governance standard and that abide by the prudential regulations will qualify for
receiving funds from the Government for their restructuring.
33. The third arm for delivering farm credit is the cooperative banking system.
Unless cooperative banks are healthy and creditworthy, it would not be possible to
reach credit to every farmer in need of credit. The situation is grave. In order to find
a durable solution, I propose to appoint a Task Force to examine the reforms required
in the cooperative banking system including the appropriate regulatory regime. The
Task Force will be requested to act with all deliberate speed and submit its report by
October 31, 2004.
Irrigation, Rural Infrastructure
34. The Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) was introduced in 1996-
97 and was allotted large funds year after year. Yet, out of 178 large and medium
irrigation projects that were identified, only 28 have been completed. The programme
is being restructured. Truly last mile projects that can be completed by March 2005
will be given overriding priority, and other projects that can be completed by March
2006 will also be taken up in the current year. Next year we shall move the goal-post
to March 2007, the year after to March 2008, and so on. I have provided a sum of
Rs.2800 crore to the AIBP this year.
35. The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) was established in NABARD
in 1994-95. Five months ago, a decision was taken to close the RIDF and establish,
in its place, another Fund with slightly different objectives. Many State Governments
and many honourable Members have opposed the closure of RIDF. In deference to
their wishes, and in tune with my own thinking, I have decided to revive the RIDF.
RIDF’s guidelines have been revised, and a corpus of Rs.8000 crore will be provided
for RIDF during 2004-05.
Restoring water bodies
36. I now turn to one of my big dreams. Water is the lifeline of civilization. We have
been warned that the biggest crisis that the world will face in the 21st century will be
the crisis of water. Water is indeed a renewable resource but, in any given year, it is
not inexhaustible. The crisis of water has affected the lives of millions of our fellow
citizens. In some cities, whole households keep awake to receive one or two buckets
of water well past midnight. In rural areas, the girl child is often pulled out of school
in order to fetch water. I am deeply concerned about the impending crisis. I therefore
propose an ambitious scheme. Through the ages, Indian agriculture has been
sustained by natural and man-made water bodies such as lakes, tanks, ponds and
8
similar structures. It has been estimated that there are more than a million such
structures and about 500,000 are used for irrigation. Many of them have fallen into
disuse. Many of them have accumulated silt. Many require urgent repairs.
37. I therefore propose to launch a massive scheme to repair, renovate and restore
all the water bodies that are directly linked to agriculture. In the current year, we
shall begin with pilot projects in at least five districts, and we shall select at least one
district in each of the five regions of the country. The estimated cost is Rs.100 crore.
Funds for the five pilot projects will be drawn from existing programmes such as
SGRY, PMGJSY, DPAP, DDP and IWDP. Once the pilot projects are completed and
validated, Government will launch the National Water Resources Development Project
and complete it over a period of 7 to 10 years.
38. Funds will not be a constraint for implementing the Project. For instance, Life
Insurance Corporation of India invests, on an average, Rs.3000 crore per year in
water-related programmes. I also intend to pose this Project to multilateral agencies
for funding. It is my hope that by the beginning of the next decade all water bodies
in India will be restored to their original glory and that the storage capacity of these
water bodies will be augmented by at least 100 per cent.
Water harvesting
39. Water harvesting schemes, specific to an area or village, have been found to be
extremely useful. Such schemes are supported by a number of credit institutions.
However, farmers belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes rarely
benefit from such schemes. In order to help these farmers, Government will launch
a nationwide water harvesting scheme. The scheme will cover one lakh irrigation
units at an average cost of Rs.20,000 per unit. NABARD will lend the money on
easy terms and no margin money will be charged from the borrower. Government
will provide a 50 per cent capital subsidy through NABARD, and the estimate for the
scheme is Rs.100 crore.
Flood control
40. Thousands of lives and thousands of head of cattle are lost every year due to
floods. Floods are perennial in States like Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar
Pradesh. The NCMP envisages full Central support to flood control works in inter-
State rivers and international rivers. The Brahmaputra Board has prepared a plan
for anti-erosion and flood control works in the Brahmaputra and Barak valleys. A
programme of flood control and anti-erosion will be launched in the current year. A
similar programme is being implemented in the Ganga-basin States of Uttaranchal,
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Rs.30 crore has been allotted
in the current year and additional funds will be provided to keep pace with the
progress of works.
Diversification
41. India is self-sufficient in wheat and paddy but deficient in other agricultural
produce. The time has come to encourage our farmers to diversify into areas such
as horticulture, floriculture and oilseeds. The Anand model has been a great success
in milk and milk products. Government proposes to launch a National Horticulture
Mission. The goal is to double horticulture production from the current level of 150
million tonnes to 300 million tonnes by 2011-12. I invite States to join hands with
9
the Government in launching this mission. One of the steps that States will be
encouraged to take is to emulate the Anand model and establish a State Level
Cooperative Society for promoting horticulture.
42. Oilseeds is another critical area. Last year, we produced 25 million tonnes of
oilseeds, but we also imported US$ 2.5 billion of edible oil. Government will facilitate
farmers to diversify into oilseeds by promoting superior seed-technology and through
an appropriate policy of price support.
43. India must become a single market for all products, particularly agricultural
produce. The existing Acts governing agricultural produce marketing committees
have outlived their utility. The Government has circulated a model law. So far, ten
States have initiated legal or administrative action for ‘direct marketing’ and ‘contract
farming’ arrangements in line with the model law. I urge all States to enact the
model law at an early date.
Research and Development
44. Agricultural research and development is an area which deserves special
attention. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is a beneficiary of the
scheme under which every commercial rupee earned by ICAR, incrementally, is
matched by another rupee from the Budget. Besides, ICAR receives funds from the
Technology Development Board in respect of projects that are commercially viable.
Agricultural research must be expanded rapidly to new frontiers such as bio-
technology, vaccines and diagnostics. There must be a special focus on farming in
drylands and unirrigated areas. The allocation for 2004-05 is Rs.1000 crore (which
is an increase from Rs.775 crore in BE 2003-04), and I propose to make further
allocations during the course of the year.
Agri-business
45. The Small Farmers Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) was set up in 1994.
Although SFAC started functioning from 1998, its corpus stands at a meagre Rs.10.95
crore. In my view, SFAC should provide venture capital to projects and must be run,
preferably by a banker, on purely business lines. The MS Swaminathan Research
Foundation has identified 13 districts where there is a huge potential for agri-
businesses and an appetite for investment of nearly Rs.170 crore. The Ministry of
Agriculture has initiated action to improve the governance of SFAC, including the
appointment of a banker as the chief executive. For my part, I propose to provide
the necessary additional capital that SFAC will require to aggressively promote
agri-businesses.
Risk mitigation
46. The Agricultural Insurance Company (AIC) was incorporated in December 2002.
The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) which insures the yield or crop
is in operation since Rabi 1999-2000. AIC is redesigning the scheme. We shall
continue with the scheme and make another evaluation. Meanwhile, a pilot scheme
insuring farm income (as opposed to crop) has been launched in 19 districts across
12 States during Rabi 2003-04. Government has decided to extend the scheme to
Kharif 2004 in order to assess its feasibility. I wish to add that a weather insurance
scheme appears to be more promising, at least in the design. AIC is introducing the
scheme on a trial basis in 20 rain gauge stations in the current crop season. It is
10
difficult to tell at this stage which of the three schemes will be successful. Agricultural
insurance as well as livestock insurance are complex products and have to be designed
with care. I wish to re-affirm Government’s commitment to provide insurance cover
to farming and livestock.
VIII. INFRASTRUCTURE
47. Sustainable growth depends upon the availability of efficient infrastructure.
Government is committed to removing the inadequacies in infrastructure facilities
through a mix of policy and fiscal measures.
Inter-Institutional Group
48. An Inter-Institutional Group in the power sector has succeeded in bringing 6
power projects to financial closure. Another 10 projects are on the verge of achieving
financial closure. The concept can be extended to some other infrastructure sectors.
I am glad to announce that IDBI, IDFC, ICICI Bank, SBI, LIC, Bank of Baroda and
Punjab National Bank have formed an Inter-Institutional Group (IIG). They will pool
their resources on a callable basis, and a sum of Rs.40,000 crore will be made
available as and when necessary. The IIG will ensure speedy conclusion of loan
agreements and implementation of infrastructure projects. Initially, airports, seaports
and tourism will be the target sectors of the IIG.
Water supply
49. The Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission was intended to be implemented in
the mission mode. In recent years, however, new programmes have sprung up
obscuring the original mission. More than 75,000 habitations are yet to be provided
adequate drinking water. Government intends to bring all drinking water schemes
under the umbrella of the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission.
50. The Accelerated Rural Water Supply Progamme (ARWSP) has been allocated
Rs.2610 crore in the current year. It will focus on renewal of water sources and on
serving uncovered and partially covered habitations. Panchayati raj institutions will
be encouraged to plan, implement, own, operate and maintain the rural water supply
schemes in consultation with the State Governments. Funds will be devolved on
Panchayati raj institutions to implement the ARWSP.
51. Likewise, the Urban Water Supply Programme is in operation in urban areas.
2151 towns qualify for consideration under the programme. In the current year a
provision of Rs.151.25 crore has been made.
52. The city of Chennai and other cities suffer from acute scarcity of drinking water.
It is proposed to install the first large desalination plant near Chennai in the State
sector, and more such plants will be installed along the Coromandel coast. A
desalination plant with a capacity of 300 million litres per day (MLD) is estimated to
cost Rs.1000 crore, and there will be other costs for transmission pipelines and a
captive power plant. It is proposed to implement the project through public-private
partnership.
Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project
53. The Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project is a longstanding demand – nay
dream – of the people of peninsular India. I am happy to inform the House that the
11
Environmental Impact Assessment study of the project has been completed by the
National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur. NEERI is
now preparing the techno-economic feasibility report and the report is expected to
be submitted shortly. The Ministry of Shipping proposes to establish a special purpose
vehicle (SPV). The SPV will raise funds for the project and Government will participate
in the funding through a mix of equity support and debt-guarantee.
International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT) at Vallarpadam
54. Government attaches high priority to the development and expansion of port
infrastructure. Presently, because of inadequate draft and cargo handling
infrastructure, and partly due to locational disadvantages, mainline vessels often
skip Indian ports. Containers from India are carried to their final destination after
transshipment at Colombo, Dubai and other neighbouring ports. Kochi has locational
advantages compared to other major Indian ports since it is closer to the main sea
routes. Government will facilitate the construction of an International Container
Transshipment Terminal (ICTT) at Vallarpadam in Kochi port on Build, Operate and
Transfer (BOT) basis.
Rural housing
55. Indira Awas Yojana (IAY) has been the main instrument to provide housing to
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as well as to the non-SC/ST rural poor.
Built into IAY is a credit-cum-subsidy scheme for rural households. A subsidy upto
Rs.10,000 and loan upto Rs.40,000 are provided to eligible households. The allocation
for IAY in BE 2003-04 was Rs.1710 crore. In the current year, I propose to raise the
allocation to Rs.2247 crore and, if more money is needed, it will be found within the
enhanced Plan outlay.
56. In order to complement IAY, the Golden Jubilee Rural Housing Finance Scheme
was launched in August 1997 to give a boost to rural housing. The response has
been encouraging, and 10.26 lakh dwelling units have been financed so far. However,
the number appears to have stagnated at about 180,000 per year in the last three
years. The scheme deserves a further stimulus. I am happy to announce that the
National Housing Bank has offered to reduce the rate of refinance by 25 basis points
this year. RBI has agreed to revise the norms of re-payment for rural housing loans
by banks, so that the instalments coincide with crop cycles. A major impediment to
credit for rural housing is absence of proper title to the land. The Government of
West Bengal has made a law to simplify the creation of security. It appears to me
that the law deserves to be emulated by other States. With these changes, I believe
it is possible to set a higher target of 250,000 rural housing units per year.
IX. INDUSTRY
57. It is my goal to make the environment in India attractive for investors. In order
to achieve that goal, I propose to establish an Investment Commission. The
Commission will have the broad authority of the Government to engage, discuss
with and invite domestic and foreign businesses to invest in India. It will be chaired
by an eminent person. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has played
a useful role, and even now it serves as a one-stop centre for securing the nod of
different ministries and departments to a proposed investment. Government believes
12
that many of the functions of FIPB could be put on the automatic route, and leave
FIPB as a one-stop service centre and facilitator. The function of wooing domestic
and foreign investors will be performed by the proposed Investment Commission.
58. Government proposes to set up a National Manufacturing Competitiveness
Council. The Council will be a continuing forum for policy dialogue to energise
and sustain the growth of manufacturing industries. The Council will be asked to
suggest measures for enhancing competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. The
Council may also recommend industry-specific or sector-specific policy initiatives
to enhance competitiveness.
59. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has the potential to add a competitive edge,
especially in the industrial sector. The NCMP declares that FDI will continue to be
encouraged and actively sought, particularly in areas of infrastructure, high
technology and exports. Three sectors of the economy fully meet this description.
They are telecommunications, civil aviation and insurance. There is an urgent need
for infusing huge amounts of capital in these sectors. I, therefore, propose to raise
the sectoral cap for FDI in telecommunications from 49 per cent to 74 per cent; in
civil aviation from 40 per cent to 49 per cent; and in insurance from 26 per cent to
49 per cent.
Capital Markets
60. Government is committed to the orderly development and functioning of the
capital markets. A number of steps have been taken to broaden and deepen the
capital markets as well as to strengthen the regulatory regime. There are some
signs that retail investors are returning to the capital market. Foreign Institutional
Investors (FIIs) have shown a marked preference for India over other emerging
markets. In order to carry forward the process of making the Indian capital market
strong and attractive, I propose to –
♦ Make the procedures for registration and operations simpler and quicker
for FIIs;
♦ Raise the investment ceiling for FIIs in debt funds from US$ 1 billion to
US$ 1.75 billion;
♦ Allow banks with strong risk management systems greater latitude in their
exposure to the capital market;
♦ Create an alternative trading platform for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) to raise equity and debt from the capital market; and
♦ Initiate steps to integrate the commodities markets and the securities
markets.
RBI and SEBI will announce the necessary measures in respect of these matters. I
am also happy to announce that SEBI has been able to resolve the longstanding
issue of brokers’ fees, and brokers may expect an announcement shortly.
61. Many genuine foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are professional bodies of
asset managers and financial analysts who can enhance the flow of equity capital
and lend depth to the capital markets. An inter-ministerial committee has
13
recommended liberalization of FII limits in certain specified sectors. I propose to
examine and implement these recommendations in consultation with the
Ministries concerned.
Public sector
62. The NCMP has declared the Government’s policy on public sector enterprises
(PSEs). While sick or ailing public sector enterprises have stirred a debate, not
enough attention is paid to the healthy PSEs. I am happy to announce that in 2004-
05 the Government will provide equity support of Rs.14,194 crore and loans of
Rs.2,132 crore to Central PSEs (including Railways). Major investments will be
made in PSEs falling in the sectors of power, telecommunications, railways, roads,
petroleum, coal and civil aviation. I am sure Hon’ble Members will appreciate the
deep commitment of Government to a strong and effective public sector operating in
a competitive environment.
63. There is, of course, another side to the public sector. This side is beset with
problems, and we must address them with responsibility and courage. Disinvestment
and privatization are useful economic tools. We will selectively employ these tools,
consistent with the declared policy. As a first step, I propose to establish a Board for
Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE). The Board will advise the
Government on the measures to be taken to restructure PSEs, including cases where
disinvestment or closure or sale is justified.
64. One of our Navaratna companies, NTPC, has filed a prospectus with SEBI to
raise capital through a public issue. Consequently, Government’s holding in NTPC
will be marginally diluted. In order to extract value for its holding and to compensate
the effect of dilution, Government intends to piggy-back on the public issue of NTPC
and disinvest approximately five per cent of its holding. This and some other cases
which are under examination are expected to yield a sum of Rs.4000 crore in the
current year. While the disinvestment revenues will be part of the Consolidated
Fund of India, I shall, while presenting the Budget for 2005-06, report to the House
the manner in which the said revenues have been or will be applied for specified
social sector schemes.
65. The NCMP contains clear policy guidelines regarding disinvestment in PSEs.
As long as Government retains control over the PSE, and its public sector character
is not affected, Government may dilute its equity and raise resources to meet the
social needs of the people. I propose to ask the BRPSE to examine each case objectively
and make recommendations on disinvestment, consistent with the NCMP.
66. I am also happy to announce that I have taken the business of restructuring
quite seriously. Hindustan Antibiotics Limited will be given financial support for
restructuring. A rescue package has been worked out for Indian Telephone Industries
(ITI), and ITI will be given Rs.508 crore to remain out of the net of the BIFR.
Small scale industry
67. Small scale industry is, and must be regarded as, an engine of growth. At the
same time SSI units must also be given the space to grow into medium enterprises.
World over, policies are devised to meet the requirements of small and medium
enterprises (SME). Keeping in mind the twin objectives, the Ministry of Small Scale
14
Industry has identified 85 items that can be safely taken out of the reserved list.
Furthermore, it is felt that technology upgradation of SSI units is the most urgent
requirement to do business in a competitive environment. I have reviewed the Capital
Subsidy Scheme, and I propose to raise the ceiling for loans under the scheme from
Rs.40 lakh to Rs.1 crore. The rate of subsidy will also be raised from 12 per cent to
15 per cent. The scope of the scheme will be enlarged by adding more sub-sectors
and technologies eligible for assistance. SSI units will be encouraged to obtain
credit rating. With these measures, I expect that many more SSI units will benefit
from the restructured scheme. A provision of Rs. 135.24 crore has been made for
“Promotion of SSI Schemes”, and within that amount funds will be found for the
Capital Subsidy Scheme.
Regeneration of traditional industries
68. Some of our traditional industries, namely coir, handloom, handicrafts,
sericulture, leather, pottery and other cottage industries not only contain great potential
for growth and exports, but are integral for the maintenance of our cultural heritage.
Accordingly, a Fund for the Regeneration of Traditional Industries, with an initial
allocation of Rs.100 crore will be set up. The details, including mechanism for utilization
of the fund will be worked out in consultation with the industries concerned.
X. OTHER PROPOSALS
VAT
69. Value-added tax is a tax that has been tested and tried, and found beneficial
throughout the world. The country needs a modern and efficient trade tax system
that incorporates the international best practices. At the June 18, 2004 meeting of
the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, to which all Finance Ministers
were invited, and chaired by my distinguished friend Dr. Asim Das Gupta, there was
a broad consensus among the States to implement VAT. April 1, 2005 has been set
as the date for implementation. I welcome the decision and warmly congratulate the
State Governments. I urge all States that have not yet passed the relevant VAT
legislation to do so before the end of 2004. International experience, as well as the
experience of the State of Haryana, suggests that VAT will lead to an increase in
revenue and not a loss in revenue. Nevertheless, in order to give comfort to the
States, I propose to evolve a formula for determining the compensation for the loss
of revenue, if any. I have offered the States the services of a Technical Experts
Committee. The Committee will work with the States closely, and help them move
steadily towards the stage of implementation.
Pension Reform
70. A ‘defined contribution’ pension scheme has been introduced with effect from
January 1, 2004 for the Central Government employees recruited on or after that
date. A suitable legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the scheme will be
introduced in Parliament.
Export promotion
71. My colleague, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, will place before Parliament
by the end of this month a new trade policy. Government is of the view that Special
Economic Zones (SEZs) are growth engines that can boost manufacturing, exports
15
and employment. The private sector has shown considerable interest in the
development of SEZs. Five SEZs have started functioning. SEZs require a special
fiscal and regulatory regime. The Commerce Minister will, shortly, introduce a Bill
for regulating Special Economic Zones, and it is my belief that the passing of such a
law would be a significant milestone in our quest to become a major hub for
manufacturing and exports.
Securitisation Act
72. The constitutional validity of the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction
of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 has been upheld
by the Supreme Court, except Sub-Section (2) of Section 17. In the wake of this
judgement, many banks have pointed out practical difficulties likely to arise in speeding
up the recovery of non-performing assets. It is proposed to amend the relevant
provisions of the Act to appropriately address the Supreme Court’s concerns regarding
a fair deal to borrowers while, at the same time, ensuring that the recovery process is
not delayed or hampered. Related amendments to the Recovery of Debts Due to
Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, if necessary, will also be made.
Interest Rates
73. The Central Government has saved considerably on interest on fresh borrowings
because of moderate interest rates. The States were also able to borrow at lower
rates and swap old high cost loans. Since 2002, States have benefited to the extent
of nearly Rs.2500 crore through the debt swap scheme. While borrowers are benefited
by moderate interest rates, there is a need to boost savings and to protect the savers.
I am convinced that, in the larger interests of the country, we should maintain a
benign interest rate regime that appropriately balances the legitimate claims of the
savers and borrowers.
74. I believe that all interest rates should be aligned to the market, save for one or
two exceptions. There is a need for a savings instrument that will give a return to
senior citizens which is above the market-determined rate. There is also a need for
an instrument that will provide a risk-free avenue for all citizens to save for a longer
term, and such an instrument should bear a slightly higher rate of interest. Balancing
these considerations, I do not propose to make any change in the existing rates of
interest on small savings instruments. Consequently, PPF, GPF and the Special
Deposit Scheme will attract 8 per cent interest this year. For senior citizens, I propose
to introduce a new scheme called the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme offering an
interest rate of 9 per cent per annum. For all other citizens, I propose to continue
the Government Savings bond which will carry an interest rate of 8 per cent per
annum. The Varishta Pension Bima Yojana may no longer be necessary since the
new savings scheme will cover the senior citizens adequately.
Reform of Public Distribution System
75. In the Tenth Plan document, the Planning Commission had suggested that a
system of distributing food stamps should be tested on a pilot basis. Every eligible
family will be entitled to collect its monthly quota of food stamps from a designated
distribution centre, and such stamps could then be used to buy foodgrains from any
food shop. I propose to introduce a pilot scheme for distributing food stamps, instead
16
of distributing food through fair price shops, in two or three contiguous districts in
a selected State. I sincerely hope that one of the States will come forward to associate
with the Central Government in this experiment.
Gender budgeting
76. Women’s groups have met me and urged me to consider gender budgeting. This
means that the budget data should be presented in a manner that the gender
sensitivities of the budgetary allocations are clearly highlighted. An expert group on
“Classification System of Government Transactions” has submitted its report on July
6, 2004. It has recommended appropriate systems for data collection and representation
in the budget. The group has also recommended introduction of periodic benefit-
incidence analysis. Government will examine the recommendations, and I hope it will
be possible for me to implement some of them in the Budget for 2005-06.
Subsidies
77. Seven years ago, I placed before Parliament the first paper on subsidies. The
NCMP pledges that all subsidies will be targeted sharply at the poor and truly needy
like small and marginal farmers, farm labour and the urban poor. I have asked the
National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) to prepare a blue print to
accomplish these objectives. I expect to place the report before the House in the
next session of Parliament.
States’ Finances
78. In order to support the States, a substantial proportion of the taxes
raised by the Central Government is transferred to the States. Besides, the Central
Government extends loans to the States. In the light of the Budget Estimates for the
current year, I am happy to report that the States’ share of Union taxes and duties
will increase to Rs.82,227 crore from Rs.63,758 crore in BE 2003-04. We are helping
the States in other ways too. One of them is the Debt Swap Scheme. I propose to
extend the facility of debt swap by allowing States to raise fresh loans and repay
their old high-cost loans to NABARD and some other agencies. I also propose to
consult the States on allowing them to increase their open market borrowings and
reduce their dependence on loans from the Central Government. I shall also consider
passing on external loans to the States on a back-to-back basis.
79. We are moving in the direction of empowering the States through devolution of
larger resources. It is my fervent hope that States will accept the obligation to
observe fiscal prudence and financial discipline.
80. Loans given by the Central Government to States carried an interest rate of
12.5 per cent. In 2003-04, the rate was reduced to 10.5 per cent. I am happy to
announce a further reduction. Loans to the States will now bear an interest rate of 9
per cent with effect from April 1, 2004. States are expected to benefit to the tune of
Rs.375 crore this year alone.
Special Economic Packages
81. The NCMP promises that special economic packages for Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir
and the North Eastern States, announced in the past, will be implemented
expeditiously. Bihar, for example, has a number of projects pending for a long time,
including projects in power, roads, drainage and rehabilitation of displaced persons.
17
I would like to assure the House that Bihar will be assisted through the Rashtriya
Sam Vikas Yojana. A provision of Rs.3225 crore has been made for the present and,
if necessary, this sum will be augmented.
North Eastern Region (NER)
82. The Government is committed to the speedy development of the North-Eastern
States and Sikkim. Accordingly, all Ministries and Departments have been mandated
to allocate at least 10 per cent of their Plan budget for schemes and programmes in
the NER. This amounts to an allocation of Rs.5823 crore to be spent in the NER.
The amount remaining unspent from this 10 per cent allocation is transferred to a
non-lapsable Central pool of resources for development of the NER. In the current
year, Rs.650 crore have been provided from the Central pool of resources for specific
projects and schemes in this region, up from Rs.550 crore in 2003-04.
Jammu & Kashmir
83. The Government will provide special assistance to the State of Jammu &
Kashmir to have a reasonable Plan size. It will also provide financial support for
the long pending Baglihar project. The Government has also agreed to provide a
grant of Rs.300 crore to the State to ensure smooth switch-over from the current
overdraft arrangement with the Bank of Jammu & Kashmir to the Ways & Means
scheme of the RBI.
Backward States’ Commission
84. NCMP envisages the creation of a Backward States Grant Commission to be
used for creating productive assets in such States. It also envisages that all non-
statutory resource transfers from the Central Government will be weighed in favour
of poor and backward States, but with performance parameters as well.
85. I am happy to announce that the Government will set up a Backward States
Grant Fund with a corpus of Rs.25,000 crore to be provided over a period of five
years. While the existing Backward Districts Initiative Scheme with an annual outlay
of about Rs.1,800 crore will be merged into this Grant Fund, the balance amount
required for the annual contribution of Rs.5,000 crore will be earmarked from out of
the total Central support to the Plan. It is expected that this will enable taking up
social and physical infrastructure programmes in the poorest and most backward
districts in the country within a given time frame. The Fund will become operational
from the financial year 2005-06. Further details will be worked out in consultation
with the Planning Commission.
Defence modernization
86. As promised in the NCMP, the Government is determined to eliminate all delays
in the modernization of the Defence Forces. Having regard to the trend of defence
capital expenditure in recent years, it has become necessary to make a higher
allocation this year. Accordingly, I propose to increase the allocation for Defence to
Rs.77,000 crore (as against Rs.65,300 crore in BE 2003-04) which includes an
allocation for capital expenditure of Rs.33,483 crore (as against Rs.20,953 crore in
BE 2003-04).
Budget Estimates for 2004-2005
87. Now, I turn to the budget estimates for the current year.
18
Plan expenditure
88. While preparing the Budget, I found that there is a plethora of Plan schemes.
The number, the variety and even the acronyms under which these schemes are
known are mind-boggling. I also found that there are many schemes with more or
less the same objectives. In some cases, all the schemes were located in one ministry
or department; in other cases, they were distributed among different ministries or
departments. Plan schemes can be broadly divided into three categories – Central
Sector, State Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. The NCMP requires that all
Centrally Sponsored Schemes, except national priority areas like family planning,
shall be transferred to the States. Fortunately, a new Planning Commission is in
place, and I am confident that the Planning Commission will bring some order into
the tangled web of schemes.
89. Plan expenditure for 2004-05 is estimated at Rs.145,590 crore as against
Rs.122,149 crore in the provisional actuals for 2003-04. While there is an increase
in plan revenue expenditure from Rs.78,537 crore in 2003-04 to Rs.91,843 crore,
there is an even sharper and welcome increase in plan capital expenditure from
Rs.43,612 crore in 2003-04 to Rs.53,747 crore.
Non-plan Expenditure
90. Non-plan expenditure in 2004-05 is estimated to be Rs.332,239 crore, lower
than Rs.349,787 crore in the provisional actuals for 2003-04 which includes capital
expenditure of Rs.46,211 crore on repayment to the National Small Savings Fund.
The increase in non-plan expenditure from the interim Budget is mainly on account
of capital expenditure in defence (Rs.11,000 crore), and assistance to Indian Telephone
Industries Ltd.
Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit
91. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates for 2004-05, the total expenditure is
estimated at Rs.477,829 crore, of which Rs.145,590 crore is for Plan and Rs.332,239
crore for non-Plan. I estimate total revenue receipts of the Central Government at
Rs.309,322 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs.385,493 crore. Consequently,
the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs.76,171 crore equivalent to 2.5 per cent of GDP,
which is one percentage point below the corresponding estimate of 3.5 per cent of
GDP in 2003-04 (according to the provisional actuals). The fiscal deficit is estimated
at Rs.137,407 crore, which is 4.4 per cent of the estimated GDP.
PART B
XI. TAX PROPOSALS
92. I shall now deal with my tax proposals.
93. Taxation is a key tool of fiscal policy. The NCMP has promised that “tax rates
will be stable and conducive to growth, compliance and investment”. Thanks to
policies initiated in the 1990s, direct tax rates are now moderate and require only
fine tuning from time to time. Indirect taxes have also been moderated through a
calibrated reduction in customs and excise duties. The proportion of direct tax
19
revenues to GDP has increased from 1.9 per cent in 1990-91 to 3.8 per cent in 2003-
04. As expected, the proportion of indirect tax revenues to GDP has declined from
7.9 per cent in 1990-91, but the decline has been rather sharp with the proportion
at 5.3 per cent in 2003-04. The weak spot is central excise. Excise revenues are
stuck, rather stubbornly, at around 3.3 per cent of GDP. While reduction in excise
duty rates partly accounts for this situation, the expansion of the manufacturing
industry ought to have given us larger revenues.
94. Through my policies on taxation, I wish to signal that we remain committed to
moderation and stability in tax rates; that we remain committed to increasing revenues
from direct taxes and excise duties; and that we remain committed to expanding the
service tax net because the services sector accounts for 51 per cent of GDP. I shall
also use tax policies to provide incentives to certain kinds of investment and to
influence certain kinds of behaviour in the market.
95. I am a votary of tax reforms but it would be unwise on my part to attempt to do
tax reform in a hurried or piece-meal manner. Seven months from now there will be
another Budget, and there will be an occasion to visit the subject of tax reform.
Direct taxes
96. I shall begin with my direct tax proposals. Let me give you the good news first.
No one with a taxable income of Rs.100,000 will be required to pay any income tax
any more. It was not easy to reach this decision. While the tax rates are moderate,
it is the tax slabs which cause concern. However, I am unable to alter the tax slabs
because I cannot afford to lose a large amount of revenue at a time when the
Government has assumed a larger responsibility for investment and welfare
programmes. Out of nearly 3.4 crore persons filing income tax returns, only 2.7
crore assessees are taxpayers. My proposal will give relief to 1.4 crore assessees.
The method that I have adopted is somewhat novel. While everyone will file his
return according to the current tax slabs and tax rates, and compute his taxable
income and the tax payable, any one with a taxable income of Rs.100,000 will
have his income tax liability automatically rebated. I cannot give more relief, or
relief across the Board, in this Budget. If compliance improves, I promise to revisit
the subject.
97. I propose to give relief to certain sections of deserving tax payers. Accordingly,
I propose to exempt from income tax the family pension received by widows, children
and nominated heirs of members of the armed forces and the paramilitary forces
killed in the course of operational duties. This is my humble salute to their
supreme sacrifice.
98. I propose to extend the benefit of Section 80DD and Section 80U in respect of
persons suffering from autism, cerebral palsy and multiple disability.
99. Farmers have brought to my notice that agricultural land situated in certain
urban agglomerations fall under the definition of capital asset and the compensation
for acquisition of such land is subjected to capital gains tax. Such compensation
deserves to be exempted from capital gains tax. I propose to do so in cases where
the compensation or the enhanced compensation has been received on or after
April 1, 2004.
20
100. A new ‘defined contribution’ pension scheme for new entrants into Central
Government service has come into effect from January 1, 2004. The tax treatment
of contributions made to the scheme has engaged the attention of Government. I
propose to adopt the universally accepted formula of EET: that is, the contributions
will be excluded from income for tax purposes; the accruals will also be exempt
from tax; and only the terminal benefits will be taxed at the applicable rate in the
year of receipt.
101. I propose to withdraw a few exemptions which have outlived their utility.
Interest earned from a Non-Resident (External) Account and interest paid by banks
to a Non-Resident or to a Not-Ordinarily Resident on deposits in foreign currency
will not be exempt from tax. Similarly, any payment made by an Indian company to
acquire an aircraft or an aircraft engine on lease from a foreign state or a foreign
enterprise will not be exempt from tax. These exemptions will cease prospectively
from September 1, 2004.
102. Hon’ble Members are aware that I abolished the gift tax in 1997. That decision
remains, but a loophole requires to be plugged to prevent money laundering.
Accordingly, purported gifts from unrelated persons, above the threshold limit of
Rs.25,000, will now be taxed as income. Gifts received from blood relations, lineal
ascendants and lineal descendants, and gifts received on certain occasions like
marriage will continue to be totally exempt.
103. In order to promote agro-processing industries, I propose to amend Section
80 IB of the Act to allow a deduction of 100 per cent of profits for 5 years and 25 per
cent of profits for the next 5 years in the case of new agro-processing industries set
up to process, preserve and package fruits and vegetables.
104. Investment in the manufacturing sector deserves the Government’s attention.
Hence, I propose to continue with the additional depreciation of 15 per cent allowed
under Section 32(1)(iia) on new plant and machinery acquired or installed in an
existing undertaking; however, the required increase in installed capacity will now
be 10 per cent, and not 25 per cent.
105. The automobile sector has done well and needs to be encouraged. I therefore
propose to notify the automobile industry as an industry entitled to 150 per cent
deduction of expenditure on in-house R&D facilities.
106. The power sector also deserves tax concessions. The Electricity Act 2003
envisages unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution. In order to
promote renovation and modernization of existing transmission and distribution
lines, I propose to extend the benefit under Section 80 IA to projects undertaken
during the period April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006.
107. The shipping industry has demanded the levy of a tonnage tax to make it
intentionally competitive. Tonnage tax will also induce more ships to fly the Indian
flag. I propose to accept the request. Consequently, the concessional regime under
Section 33 AC will be withdrawn and shipping companies will now have only an
option to pay the tonnage tax or normal corporate tax on profits.
21
108. I propose to extend the benefit of Section 80 IB to new hospitals with 100 beds
or more set up in rural areas. Such hospitals will be entitled to a 100 per cent
deduction of their profits for a period of five years.
109. The housing industry enjoys certain benefits under Section 80 IB for
projects approved before March 31, 2005. I propose to extend the time limit to
March 31, 2007.
110. A small problem has plagued the reconstruction and development of existing
buildings under approved plans in the city of Mumbai. Perhaps the problem is there
in some other cities too. I, therefore, propose to relax the condition of minimum plot
size of one acre in the case of housing projects, as long as the projects are implemented
in accordance with a scheme for reconstruction or development approved by the
Central or State Government.
111. Capital gains tax is another vexed issue. When applied to capital market
transactions, the issue becomes more complex. Questions have been raised about
the definitions of long-term and short-term, and the differential tax treatment meted
to the two kinds of gains. There are no easy answers, but I have decided to make a
beginning by revamping taxes on securities transactions. Our founding fathers had
wisely included entry 90 in the Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution
of India. Taking a cue from that entry, I propose to abolish the tax on long-term
capital gains from securities transactions altogether. Instead, I propose to levy a
small tax on transactions in securities on stock exchanges. The rate will be 0.15 per
cent of the value of security. Thus, a transaction involving securities valued at, say,
Rs.100,000 will now bear a small tax of Rs.150. The tax will be levied on the buyer.
In the case of short-term capital gains from securities, I propose to reduce the rate of
tax to a flat rate of 10 per cent. My calculation shows that the new tax regime will be
a win-win situation for all concerned.
112. I propose to make a change in the tax on dividends distributed by mutual
funds. Equity-oriented mutual funds will continue to be exempt from tax. Debt-
oriented mutual funds are now required to withhold 12.5 per cent of the income
distributed to unit holders. Individuals and HUF unit holders will continue to enjoy
the benefit of this rate. However, in the case of corporate unit holders, I propose a
rate of 20 per cent. I am sure corporates will understand, because I am doing no
more than partially closing a window of arbitrage opportunity.
113. I propose to put an end to bonus-stripping and dividend-stripping in units by
making a suitable amendment to Section 94 of the Act.
114. I also propose some measures to widen the tax base and to plug revenue
leakage. I do not wish to take the time of the House detailing each measure.
115. Tax deduction at source (TDS) and tax collection at source (TCS) are being
extended to some more activities. Amendments are proposed to Section 40(a)(i) and
Section 194 C.
116. The telecom sector enjoyed certain benefits under Section 80 IA for services
commenced before March 31, 2004. Pending a detailed examination of the needs of
the telecom sector, I propose to extend the terminal date to March 31, 2005.
22
117. Companies carrying on scientific research and development and approved by
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research before April 1, 2004 are entitled
to 100 per cent deduction of profits for 10 years. On the request of the Department
of Bio-Technology and pending a detailed examination, I propose to extend the
terminal date to March 31, 2005.
118. New industrial undertakings in Jammu & Kashmir enjoyed 100 per cent tax
exemption if they commenced production before March 31, 2004. Pending a detailed
examination of the incentives required to promote industrial development in Jammu
& Kashmir, I propose to extend the date to March 31, 2005.
Indirect taxes
119. Now, I turn to my indirect tax proposals. The policy signal that needs to be
reiterated is that customs duties will be brought down in a measured way. It is my
intention to align India’s tariff structure to those of ASEAN countries. Eventually,
there should be a uniform rate of tax on goods and services. During the last four
years, my predecessors had adjusted excise duties and moved them towards a Central
VAT rate. That process must continue. The most important goods in the
manufacturing sector must therefore bear an excise duty of 16 per cent.
120. Another principle that requires to be emphasized is that where an excise duty
is levied, subject to only a few exceptions, like goods when imported should attract
an equivalent countervailing duty (CVD). In my tax proposals, I have, therefore,
removed the exemption from CVD enjoyed by some imported goods where there is
no corresponding exemption from excise duty on Indian made goods.
121. I may also point out that customs tariffs and excise duties are inter-related.
While considering the tax regime for any sector, one must look at both customs
duties and excise duties applicable to that sector.
122. The peak rate of customs duty was reduced to 20 per cent in January 2004. I
propose to maintain the peak rate for the rest of the current fiscal year.
123. I shall now deal with specific sectors beginning with metals, minerals and
industrial raw materials. Steel is the leading metal. Normally, it should bear an
excise duty of 16 per cent. However, in February this year, excise duty on steel was
reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent, but with the caveat that the decision will be
reviewed when the regular budget is presented. Belying expectations, steel prices
have not moderated but have risen sharply. I propose to reduce the customs duty on
non-alloy steel from 15 per cent to 10 per cent and to increase the excise duty on steel
from 8 per cent to 12 per cent so that the countervailing duty will also be applicable to
imports. I hope to recoup some of the revenue losses since February 2004.
124. Alloy steel, copper, lead, zinc and base metals are basic raw materials used in
a variety of industries. I propose to reduce the peak rate on such metals to 15 per
cent. I also propose to reduce the customs duties on refractory raw minerals and
mineral products like graphite, asbestos, mica and gypsum to 15 per cent. The
customs duty on all catalysts will also be 15 per cent.
125 I propose certain concessions to the agriculture sector. To encourage value
addition, while retaining customs duty on crude palm oil at 65 per cent, I propose to
23
accept the recommendation of the Tariff Commission and increase the duty on refined
palm oil to 75 per cent.
126. Some items of plantation machinery attract a customs duty of 5 per cent. I
propose to extend the concessional rate to more items pertaining to the tea and
coffee plantation sector.
127. On the excise front, I propose to make a number of concessions. Tractors
attract an excise duty of 16 per cent. Hereafter, tractors will be fully exempt. Likewise,
dairy machinery which attracts an excise duty of 16 per cent will be fully exempt.
Hand tools such as spades, shovels, sickles etc, which currently attract a 16 per
cent excise duty will also be fully exempt.
128. Excise duty on preparations of meat, poultry and fish will be reduced from 16
per cent to 8 per cent and excise duty on food grade hexane (used in the edible oil
industry) will be reduced from 32 per cent to 16 per cent.
129. I propose to give some concessions to the health sector. A number of items for
the disabled are already exempt from import duties or attract a concessional duty of
5 per cent. I propose that rehabilitation aids such as talking books, braille computer
terminals, braille writers and typewriters, assistive listening devices, cochlear implants
and stair lifts be fully exempt from customs duty. They will also be exempt from
excise duty and CVD. Crutches, wheel chairs, walking frames, artificial limbs, etc.
for the disabled will also be fully exempt from customs duty. There are some
restrictions on institutions for the visually-impaired and the hearing-impaired availing
of import duty exemptions. I propose to remove these restrictions as well as enlarge
the list of exempted appliances. Ambulances used by government and municipal
hospitals alone have been allowed the concessional excise duty of 16 per cent. I
propose that all ambulances registered as such will be entitled to this benefit.
Diagnostic kits for detecting hepatitis B alone are exempt from excise duty. I propose
to extend the exemption to kits for detection of all types of hepatitis.
130. In order to move toward the Cenvat rate, I propose to levy excise duty on
contact lenses and playing cards. I also propose to increase the excise duty from 8
per cent to 16 per cent on a few items including vaccum flasks, plastic insulated
ware, scented supari, prefabricated buildings, laboratory glassware, black and white
television sets, populated PCBs, imitation jewellery, candles and parts of clocks and
watches. Let me hasten to add that in all these cases the general SSI exemption will
continue to be available, and consumers and small manufacturers will not be affected
at all. Even other manufacturers will avail of Cenvat credit.
131. In order to protect matches made in the non-mechanised sector, I propose to
increase the excise duty on matches made in the mechanized/semi-mechanised
sector from 8 per cent without Cenvat credit to 16 per cent with Cenvat credit.
132. The Information Technology sector has, by and large, been kept out of the
reach of the tax collector. Under the Information Technology Agreement, customs
duty will be brought down to zero in 2005. Meanwhile, I propose to abide by the
bound rates under the agreement.
133. I propose to exempt specified raw materials for manufacture of parts of cathode
ray tubes and specified capital goods for manufacture of mobile handsets, plasma
24
display panels etc. from excise duty. Specified items for manufacture of telecom
grade optical fibres and cables are also proposed to be exempt from customs duty.
Mobile switching centres imported by cellular mobile telephone service providers are
now exempt from customs duty. I propose to extend the exemption to imports by
universal access service providers.
134. Computers attract excise duty of 8 per cent. I propose to grant full exemption.
135. I propose to give some excise relief to LPG gas stoves bearing an MRP up
to Rs.2000, footwear with MRP upto Rs.250 and writing instruments with MRP
upto Rs.200.
136. I propose to reduce the excise duty on amusement rides from 20 per cent to
10 per cent.
137. Having been Commerce Minister, export promotion is close to my heart. I
propose to extend the concessional customs duty of 5 per cent on capital goods
enjoyed by the leather industry to the non-leather footwear industry too.
138. Finished leather of all kinds is exempt from customs duty. I propose to exempt
patent leather also.
139. Platinum is a serious challenger to gold in the jewellery industry. Both should
be treated alike. Hence, I propose to reduce the import duty on platinum from
Rs.550 per 10 grams to Rs.200. I propose that rough coloured precious gemstones
should be exempt from customs duty just as rough semiprecious stones are.
140. Area specific exemptions from excise duty have been granted from time to
time. The North Eastern States and J&K are in a class by themselves. The exemptions
enjoyed by them will continue. Sikkim, Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh were
also granted area-based exemptions. Hon’ble Members are fully aware of the
arguments in favour and the rival arguments against. I have to be fair to both sides.
Accordingly, I propose that area specific exemptions enjoyed by States other than
the North Eastern States and J & K will continue and be available to units set up or
expanded on or before March 31, 2007.
141. I shall now deal with the most challenging tax problem that I faced this year.
This relates to the textile sector. Last year, handlooms and powerlooms were brought
into what is described as the Cenvat chain. The intention was good but, I am
afraid, the decision did not take into account the decentralized and fragmented
nature of production of fabrics in the country. Besides, the so-called Cenvat chain
had nearly 40 exemptions at different stages. In fact, two exemptions were added
after the decision.
142. I am conscious that the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing will come to an
end on December 31, 2004. Our textile sector must, therefore, be made more efficient
and competitive. Those who can compete because of their organizational strength
should be allowed to compete; for the rest, we must allow more time to comply with
a mandatory tax regime. Meanwhile, there must be a level playing field.
143. If I have understood correctly the mind of Hon’ble Members of Parliament, and
of the leaders of various political parties, I believe that there is a universal demand
25
to free the handloom and powerloom sectors from the Cenvat regime. After giving
my anxious consideration to the complex issues, I propose to withdraw the
mandatory Cenvat duty. Instead, I propose to introduce a new tax regime for the
textile sector and, in this exercise, I am happy to say that I have the full support of
the Minister of Textiles.
144. Let me now explain briefly the new regime.
♦ Firstly, the mandatory Cenvat chain will stand abolished.
♦ Secondly, there will be no mandatory excise duty on pure cotton, wool and
silk, whether it is fibre, yarn, fabric or garment.
♦ Thirdly, blended textiles and pure non-cotton (polyester, viscose, acrylic
and nylon) will have a different tax regime.
♦ Fourthly, there will be a mandatory excise duty on man-made staple fibre
at 16 per cent; on polyester filament yarn (including textured yarn) at 24
per cent; and on other man-made filament yarn (including textured yarn)
at 16 per cent.
145. Every manufacturer – be it handloom or powerloom or composite mill – will
have the option to choose between two routes. One will be the exemption route and
the other will be the Cenvat route. Under the exemption route, no excise duty will be
payable at any stage (except on man-made fibre and filament yarn). Under the
Cenvat route, credit can be taken for all excise duties paid at earlier stages. For the
purposes of the optional Cenvat route, it is necessary to specify in the Tariff schedule
the applicable excise duty rates. For the pure cotton sector, the uniform rate will be
4 per cent on yarn, fabrics, garments and made-ups. For the blended textiles sector
and pure non-cotton sector, the uniform rate will be 8 per cent.
146. It is my firm belief that the millions of handloom weavers and powerloom
weavers will welcome the new regime. As far as the composite mills are concerned,
there is no cause for worry. They are also free to take the exemption route, but if
they choose to opt for the Cenvat route, they may do so and claim Cenvat credit for
all duties paid at earlier stages. Garment exporters should give the new regime a
fair chance. I expect that prices of fabrics will moderate and garment exporters will
stand to benefit. Their concerns, if any, can be addressed through the drawback or
DEPB mechanism.
147. In course of time, it is possible that some manufacturers of handlooms and
powerlooms will take advantage of the low uniform rates of duty and opt for the
Cenvat route.
148. There remains the service tax. I propose to take a major step towards
integrating the tax on goods and services. Accordingly, I propose to extend credit of
service tax and excise duty across goods and services. In order to neutralize the
revenue impact of such extension, and keeping in mind the mean Cenvat rate, I
propose to enhance the rate of service tax from 8 per cent to 10 per cent.
149. 58 services have been brought under the net so far. I propose to add some
more this year. These are business exhibition services; airport services; services
provided by transport booking agents; transport of goods by air; survey and exploration
26
services; opinion poll services; intellectual property services other than copy right;
brokers of forward contracts; pandal and shamiana contractors; outdoor caterers;
independent TV/radio programme producers; construction services in respect of
commercial or industrial constructions; and life insurance services to the extent
of the risk premium. I may clarify that there is no intention to levy service tax on
truck owners or truck operators. Nor, as was clarified by my predecessor, is
there any intention to levy service tax on the savings part of the premium collected
by an insurer.
150. I also propose that some currently taxable services should be redefined to
cover all service providers falling under the same category, but I do not wish to
burden this speech with the details. Exemptions granted in the case of some taxable
services are proposed to be removed. The administration of service tax will be made
more tax-payer-friendly. I propose to do away with the mandatory verification of self
assessment and the mandatory penalty for non-registration.
151. Finally, there is the tax mandated by the NCMP. That is an education cess on
all taxes. I propose to levy a cess of 2 per cent on income tax, corporation tax, excise
duties, customs duties and service tax.
152. Besides my tax proposals, I have looked at another source of revenue. There
are large recoverable arrears both in direct taxes and indirect taxes. Even the
undisputed arrears are quite substantial. I have, therefore, assumed that I would
be able to recover a tidy sum this year. A special, multi-pronged drive will be made
to recover these arrears, the details of which will be announced later.
153. My tax proposals on direct taxes are expected to yield a gain of Rs.2000 crore.
On the indirect taxes side, they are broadly revenue neutral.
XII. CONCLUSION
154. Mr. Speaker, Sir. The countries of the world, India included, have set for
themselves the Millennium Development Goals. Our date with destiny is not at the
end of the millennium, but in the year 2015. Will we achieve those goals? In the
eleven years that remain, it is in our hands to shape our destiny. Progress is not
always on a linear path, nor is it inevitable. Two thousand years ago, Saint Tirvalluvar
said:
“Aran Izhukkathu Allavai Neeki Maran Izhukka
Maanam Udayathu Arasu”
(They are good rulers who observe ethics, commit no crime and walk
the path of honour and courage)
If we bring thought and passion to our goverance, and walk the path of honour and
courage, we can make the future happen. And this century will be India’s century.
155. Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House.

Interim Budget 2014-2015
Speech of
P. Chidambaram
Minister of Finance
February 17, 2014
Madam Speaker,
INTRODUCTION
I rise to present the Interim Budget for 2014-15.
The Current Economic Situation
2. As I prepared to write this speech, I found that whether it is a regular Budget for the
full year or an interim Budget, some things remain the same. For example, our goals are the
same and the global context is the same. As I said last year, we are not unaffected by what
happens in the rest of the world. Since September 2008, the state of the world economy has
been the most decisive factor impacting the fortunes of every developing country. Hence, it is
pertinent to say a few words on the global economy as well as on the global risks.
3. World economic growth was 3.9 percent in 2011, 3.1 percent in 2012 and 3.0 percent
in 2013. Those numbers tell the story. Among India’s major trading partners, who are also
the major sources of our foreign capital inflows, the United States has just recovered from a
long recession; Japan’s economy is responding to the stimulus; the Eurozone, as a whole, is
reporting a growth of 0.2 percent; and China’s growth has slowed from 9.3 percent in 2011 to
7.7 percent in 2013.
4. The Global Risks 2014 report has mapped 31 global risks. Of highest concern are ten
risks that include fiscal crisis, structurally high unemployment or underemployment, income
disparity, governance failure, food crisis, and political and social instability. The challenges
that we face are common to all emerging economies. 2012 and 2013 were years of
turbulence. Only a handful of countries were able to keep their head above the water, and
among them was India. I shall presently give you an account of how we navigated the Indian
economy through this turbulent period.
Challenges and Goals
5. Within days of my return to the Ministry of Finance, I had declared that our objectives
were fiscal consolidation, price stability, self-sufficiency in food, reviving the growth cycle,
enhancing investments, promoting manufacturing, encouraging exports, quickening the pace
of implementation of projects, and finding practical solutions to certain stressed sectors such
as petroleum, power, coal, highways and textiles.
STATE OF THE ECONOMY
The Twin Deficits and Inflation
6. Let me begin with the good news. The fiscal deficit for 2013-14 will be contained at
4.6 percent of GDP, well below the red line that I had drawn last year. More importantly,
the Current Account Deficit, that threatened to exceed last year’s CAD of USD 88 billion,
will be contained at USD 45 billion, and I am happy to inform the House that we expect to
add about USD 15 billion to the foreign exchange reserves by the end of the financial year.
Analysts and rating agencies had acknowledged our efforts some months ago and no longer
speak about a downgrade. I hope that domestic experts will now agree that the UPA
Government meant what it said when it put fiscal stability at the top of the agenda. Going
forward, I appeal to all political parties to join me in the pledge that we shall not – we shall
never – do anything that will affect the stability of the foundations of India’s economy.
7. Last year, when I read the Budget speech, WPI headline inflation stood at 7.3 percent
and core inflation at 4.2 percent. Through the year, inflation saw its ups and downs. At the
end of January 2014, WPI inflation was 5.05 percent and core inflation 3.0 percent. Both the
Government and the RBI have acted in tandem. While our efforts have not been in vain,
there is still some distance to go. Food inflation is still the main worry, although it has
declined sharply from a high of 13.6 percent to 6.2 percent.
Agriculture
8. We are proud of the stellar performance of the agriculture sector. Foodgrain
production in 2012-13 was 255.36 million tonnes and the estimate for the current year is 263
million tonnes. Estimates of production of sugarcane, cotton, pulses, oilseeds and quality
seeds point to new records. Agriculture exports in 2012-13 stood at USD 41 billion versus
imports of USD 20 billion. In 2013-14, agriculture exports are likely to cross USD 45
billion. Agricultural credit is likely to touch `735,000 crore, exceeding the target of `700,000
crore. Agricultural GDP growth increased to 3.1 percent in the five year period of
UPA-I and further to 4.0 percent in the first four years of UPA-II. In the current year,
agricultural GDP growth is estimated at 4.6 percent.
Investment
9. Even after the slowdown, the savings rate was 31.3 percent in 2011-12 and 30.1
percent in 2012-13. The corresponding investment rate was 35.5 percent and 34.8 percent,
respectively, indicating there was no steep decline in investment, except in mining and
manufacturing. If the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) had remained more or less the
same, the outcome should have been a growth rate higher than the 6.7 percent and the 4.5
percent reported so far by the CSO for the two years, but that did not happen. It was obvious
that projects were not achieving commercial operation date (COD) and there were too many
obstacles on the path of implementation. At a time when it appeared that a number of
projects would fail because of the logjam, Government took the bold step to set up the
Cabinet Committee on Investment and the Project Monitoring Group. Thanks to the swift
decisions taken by them, by the end of January, 2014, the way was cleared for completing
296 projects with an estimated project cost of `660,000 crore.
Foreign Trade
10. Exports have recovered sharply, and the recovery must be seen in the context of
growth of global trade declining from 6.1 percent in 2011 to 2.7 percent in 2013. India’s
merchandise exports reached a level of USD 300.4 billion in 2012-13 registering a negative
growth of 1.8 percent over the previous year. Though 2013-14 began on a pessimistic note, I
am happy to inform the House that the year will end with estimated merchandise exports of
USD 326 billion, indicating a growth rate of 6.3 percent. However, imports are down, and
this does not augur well for either manufacturing or domestic trade. Our aim must be robust
growth in both exports and imports, with trade in balance over a period of time.
Manufacturing
11. Manufacturing is the Achilles’ heel of the Indian economy. The deceleration in
investment in manufacturing is particularly worrying. Consequently, there is no uptick yet in
manufacturing. The National Manufacturing Policy has set the goal of increasing the share of
manufacturing in GDP to 25 percent and to create 100 million jobs over a decade. Eight
National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZ) have been announced along the
Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and nine projects have been approved by the DMIC Trust.
Five NIMZs outside DMIC have also been given in-principle approval. Three more corridors
connecting Chennai and Bengaluru, Bengaluru and Mumbai, and Amritsar and Kolkata are
under different stages of preparatory work. Additional capacities are being installed in major
manufacturing industries such as steel, cement, refinery, power and electronics. Several
measures have been taken to promote micro, small and medium enterprises including
notifying a public procurement policy, establishing technology centres and common facility
centres, and launching the Khadi mark.
Infrastructure
12. We have given a big push to infrastructure and capacity addition in infrastructure
industries. In 2012-13 and in the nine months of the current financial year, we have added
29,350 megawatts of power capacity, 3,928 kilometres of national highways, 39,144
kilometres of rural roads under PMGSY, 3,343 kilometres of new railway track, and 217.5
million tonnes of capacity per annum in our ports. Besides, 19 oil and gas blocks were given
out for exploration and 7 new airports are under construction. We have also facilitated
Infrastructure Debt Funds to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects and ease the
pressure on the banking system.
Exchange Rate
13. Risks to capital flows were accentuated due to volatile global conditions and the
indication, in May 2013, of a reduction in asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve. The
rupee came under pressure. Government, RBI and SEBI undertook a number of measures to
facilitate capital inflows and stabilise the foreign exchange market. Among emerging
economy currencies, the rupee was affected least when the actual reduction took place in
December 2013 and January 2014.
GDP Growth – Decline and Rise
14. Hon’ble Members will recall that the slowdown began in 2011-12. In nine quarters,
the GDP growth rate declined from 7.5 percent in Q1 of 2011-12 to 4.4 percent in Q1 of
2013-14. Thanks to the numerous measures that I have narrated, I was confident that the
decline will be arrested and the growth cycle will turn in the second quarter. I believe I have
been vindicated. Growth in Q2 of 2013-14 has been placed at 4.8 percent and growth for the
whole year has been estimated at 4.9 percent. This means that growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2013-
14 will be at least 5.2 percent.
15. I can confidently assert that the economy is more stable today than what it was two
years ago. The fiscal deficit is declining, the current account deficit has been contained,
inflation has moderated, the quarterly growth rate is on the rise, the exchange rate is stable,
exports have increased, and hundreds of projects have been unblocked.
16. Madam Speaker, all this is the result of hard work. I may add, among other mentors,
my mother and Harvard taught me the value of hard work.
UPA’s Record of Growth
17. Over the last ten years, the UPA Governments have gently nudged India and Indians
into accepting that growth is an imperative; that it must be made more inclusive and
converted into development; and that the growth model, in order to be sustainable, must
address other concerns such as environment, inter-generational equity, indebtedness,
ownership and control of resources, financing etc.
18. The UPA Governments’ record on growth is unparalleled.
19. Ten years ago, we produced 213 million tonnes of food grains; today, we produce 263
million tonnes of food grains. Ten years ago, the installed power capacity was 112,700 MW;
today, it is 234,600 MW. Ten years ago, coal production was 361 million tonnes per year;
today, we produce 554 million tonnes per year. Ten years ago, there were 51,511 km of rural
roads under PMGSY; today, we have 389,578 km. Ten years ago, the Central Government’s
expenditure on education was `10,145 crore; this year, we allocated `79,451 crore. Ten
years ago, the Central Government spent `7,248 crore on health; this year, it will spend
`36,322 crore. I could multiply the examples, but what I have given will suffice.
20. Madam Speaker, I reject the argument of policy paralysis. Just as there are business
cycles, there is a cycle around the trend growth rate of an economy. Over a period of 33
years, the trend growth rate in India has been 6.2 percent. Average annual GDP growth
during the period 1999-2004 was 5.9 percent, that is below the trend rate. In the next five
year period 2004-2009, it was 8.4 percent and, in the period 2009-2014, going by the CSO’s
estimate, it will be 6.6 percent. UPA-I and UPA-II have delivered above the trend growth
rate.
21. Let history be the judge of the last ten years.
REPORT CARD OF 2013-14
22. I owe a duty to my colleagues to report on some of the major achievements in the
current financial year that concerns the economy of the country and the welfare of the people.
We are not simply looking back, we are actually looking forward, and therefore I shall also
report on the initiatives that are being taken by my colleagues.
Path-breaking Decisions
23. Government took several notable decisions including some that were described as
courageous and long overdue. Sugar was fully decontrolled. A gradual correction of diesel
prices was started. Railway fares were rationalised for the first time in a decade.
Applications were invited for issue of new bank licences. DISCOMS, mostly sick, are being
restructured with generous Central assistance.
Historic Legislations
24. 12.8 lakh land titles covering 18.80 lakh hectare were distributed under the Scheduled
Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act.
25. The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act was notified on 1.1.2014, finally putting to rest an
oppressive colonial law of 1894.
26. The National Food Security Act was passed assuring foodgrain to 67 percent of the
population.
27. The new Companies Act replaced a law of 1956 vintage.
28. The PFRDA Act was passed placing the New Pension System on a statutory basis and
establishing a statutory regulator.
Economic Initiatives
29. Centrally Sponsored Schemes were restructured into 66 programmes for greater
synergy. Funds under these programmes will be released as Central assistance to State plans,
thus giving States greater authority and responsibility. As a result, Central assistance to plans
of States and Union Territories will rise substantially from `136,254 crore in BE 2013-14 to
`338,562 crore in 2014-15.
30. Public sector enterprises will achieve a new record in capital expenditure of `257,641
crore in 2013-14.
31. About 50,000 MW of thermal and hydel power capacity is under construction after
receiving all clearances and approvals. 78,000 MW of power capacity has been assured coal
supply.
32. The FDI policy was liberalized to attract larger investments in telecommunication,
pharmaceuticals, civil aviation, power trading exchanges and multi-brand retail.
33. Approval was granted to establish two semi-conductor wafer fab units that will be the
bedrock of the electronics hardware industry.
34. The IT modernisation project of the Department of Posts, with an outlay of `4,909
crore, will be operational by 2015 in all 155,000 locations.
35. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit I achieved criticality and is generating
180 million units of power. The 500 MW prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam is
nearing completion. Seven nuclear power reactors are under construction with the aim of
achieving an installed capacity of 10,080 MW by the end of the Twelfth Plan.
36. After exceeding the target and achieving 1,684 MW of grid connected solar power,
the National Solar Mission entered the second phase on 1.4.2013. It is proposed to take up
four ultra mega solar power projects each with a capacity of over 500 MW in 2014-15.
37. Ministry of MSME will create the ‘India Inclusive Innovation Fund’ to promote
grassroot innovations with social returns to support enterprises in the MSME sector. I
propose to make an initial contribution of `100 crore to the corpus of the Fund.
Social Sector Initiatives
38. In order to promote entrepreneurship among the scheduled castes and to provide
concessional finance to them, IFCI will set up a Venture Capital Fund for Scheduled Castes.
I propose to provide an initial capital of `200 crore, which can be supplemented every year.
39. The restructured ICDS has been implemented in 400 districts and will be rolled out in
the remaining districts from 1.4.2014.
40. Government has approved the National Agro-Forestry Policy 2014 which has multiple
objectives including employment, productivity, conservation and adaptation.
41. A mechanism for marketing minor forest produce has been introduced, and the
Budget has allocated `444.59 crore to continue the scheme in 2014-15.
42. A new plan scheme with an allocation of `100 crore has been approved to promote
community radio stations.
43. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has delivered new technologies to the people:
the JE vaccine, a diagnostic test for Thalassaemia, and a Magnivisualizer for detection of
cervical cancer.
Additional Central Assistance to some States
44. The North Eastern States, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand deserve special
attention. In addition to funds allocated in the current year, I propose to release a sum of
`1,200 crore as Additional Central Assistance to these States before the end of the year.
Space
45. India joined a handful of countries when it launched the Mars Orbiter Mission. We
now have the capability in launch vehicle technology, cryogenics, and navigation,
meteorological and communication satellites, and are largely self-reliant. Several flight tests,
navigational satellites and space missions are planned for 2014-15.
Redeeming Our Promises
46. Last year, I had made three promises and I had asked Hon’ble Members to keep
before them the faces of the girl child, the young student, and the poor. To ensure the dignity
and safety of women, I promised the Nirbhaya Fund and put `1000 crore into the Fund. So
far, we have approved two proposals that will receive support from the Fund. In order to
make it clear that the Fund will be a permanent fund, I intend to declare the grant of `1000
crore as non-lapsable. And in order to support more proposals, I propose to contribute to the
Fund another sum of `1000 crore next year.
47. Secondly, I had promised an ambitious programme to skill millions of young men and
women and had tasked the National Skill Development Corporation to implement the
programme. The National Skill Certification and Monetary Reward Scheme was launched in
August 2013 and has been widely hailed as a success. At last count, 24 Sector Skill Councils,
442 Training Partners and 17 Assessment Agencies had joined the programme. 204 job roles
have been finalised. 168,043 youth had enrolled and 77,710 have completed their training.
Hon’ble Members will recall that I had set apart `1,000 crore for the scheme. The whole of
that amount will be transferred to the NSD Trust and I propose to transfer another sum of
`1,000 crore next year to enable the Trust to scale up the programme of NSDC rapidly. I
may add that NSDC actually complements the initiatives of several ministries which steer
skill development programmes such as UDAAN in Jammu and Kashmir.
48. Thirdly, I had promised that the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme would be rolled out
throughout the country. The scheme is barely a year old. Money is being transferred to
beneficiaries under 27 identified schemes, including the National Social Assistance
Programme (NSAP). A total of 54,20,114 transactions have been put through until 31.1.2014
and `628 crore has been transferred. Another sum of `3,370 crore has been transferred to 2.1
crore LPG beneficiaries. The latter scheme has been put on hold for the time being pending
resolution of some difficulties that have been pointed out. However, let me reiterate that the
Government remains fully committed to Aadhaar under which 57 crore unique numbers have
been issued so far and to opening bank accounts for all Aadhaar holders in order to promote
financial inclusion. Who needs Aadhaar? It is those who are at the bottom of the pyramid,
the poor, the migrant workers, the homeless, and the oppressed who need Aadhaar, and we
will ensure that they get Aadhaar. I have no doubt that in course of time even critics of
Aadhaar will realise that Aadhaar is a tool of empowerment.
OVERVIEW OF THE INTERIM BUDGET
Plan and Non-Plan Expenditure
49. I shall now give an overview of the interim Budget. In some years, we over-provide
in the Budget. In those years savings are inevitable. Besides, if there is lower-than-expected-
growth there will be lower-than-estimated-revenues as well. 2013-14 has been one such year.
I am afraid, we will not be able to spend the budgeted plan expenditure, but non-plan
expenditure will exceed the budget by a small amount.
50. In order to sustain the pace of plan expenditure, I have decided to keep plan
expenditure in 2014-15 at the same level at which it was budgeted in 2013-14. I have
provided `555,322 crore for plan expenditure. I am glad to inform the House that all the
ministries/departments that run key flagship programmes of the UPA Government have been
provided adequate funds. In all the following cases, I have provided in 2014-15 an amount
equal to or higher than in the BE of 2013-14 and irrespective of the revised estimates for the
year:
Ministry of Minority Affairs .. `3,711 crore
Ministry of Tribal Affairs .. `4,379 crore
Ministry of Housing & Poverty Alleviation .. `6,000 crore
Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment .. `6,730 crore
Ministry of Panchayati Raj .. ` 7,000 crore
Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation .. `15,260 crore
Ministry of Women & Child Development .. `21,000 crore
Ministry of Health & Family Welfare .. `33,725 crore
Ministry of Human Resource Development .. `67,398 crore
Ministry of Rural Development .. `82,202 crore
Railways
51. My colleague, the Minister of Railways, presented the Railway Budget a few days
ago. Budgetary support to Railways has been increased from `26,000 crore in BE 2013-14 to
`29,000 crore in 2014-15. Railways need to mobilise huge resources through market
borrowing and private public partnership (PPP) schemes. It is proposed to identify new
instruments and new mechanisms to raise funds for railway projects.
SC Sub-Plan and Tribal Sub-Plan,
Gender Budget and Child Budget
52. Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that I propose to allocate `48,638 crore to
the scheduled caste sub-plan and `30,726 crore to the tribal sub-plan. They will also be
happy to find that the gender budget has `97,533 crore and the child budget has `81,024
crore.
53. I am confident that there will be no cause for complaint. If there are any
shortcomings, they can be addressed when the regular budget is presented. There is enough
flexibility in the expenditure budget to make necessary changes in the allocations within the
overall resource envelope.
54. Non-plan expenditure in 2014-15 is estimated at `12,07,892 crore. Of this, the
expenditure on subsidies for food, fertilizer and fuel will be `246,397 crore. This is slightly
more than the revised estimate of `245,452 crore in 2013-14. For fuel subsidy, I have
provided `65,000 crore. We have, this year, absorbed the rollover of `45,000 crore from the
fourth quarter of 2012-13 and we will rollover only `35,000 crore from the fourth quarter of
this year into the next year. `115,000 crore has been allocated for food subsidy keeping in
mind our Government’s firm and irrevocable commitment to implement the National Food
Security Act throughout the country.
Defence
55. The allocation for defence has been enhanced by 10 percent from `203,672 crore in
BE 2013-14 to `224,000 crore in 2014-15.
One Rank One Pension
56. Hon’ble Members are aware of the long standing demand of the Defence Services for
One Rank One Pension (OROP). It is an emotive issue, it has legal implications, and it has to
be handled with great sensitivity. During the tenure of the UPA Governments, changes in
the pension rules applicable to the defence services were notified on three occasions in 2006,
2010 and 2013. As a result, the gap between pre-2006 retirees and post-2006 retirees has
been closed in four ranks (subject to some anomalies that are being addressed): Havildar,
Naib Subedar, Subedar and Subedar Major. There is still a small gap in the ranks of Sepoy
and Naik and a gap in the ranks of Major and above. We need a young fighting force, we
need young jawans, and we need young officers. We also need to take care of those who
served in the defence forces only for a limited number of years. Government has therefore
decided to walk the last mile and close the gap for all retirees in all ranks. I am happy to
announce that Government has accepted the principle of One Rank One Pension for the
defence forces. This decision will be implemented prospectively from the financial year
2014-15. The requirement for 2014-15 is estimated at `500 crore and, as an earnest of the
UPA Government’s commitment, I propose to transfer a sum of `500 crore to the Defence
Pension Account in the current financial year itself.
Central Armed Police Forces
57. A modernisation plan at a cost of `11,009 crore has been approved to strengthen the
capacity of Central Armed Police Forces and to provide them state-of-the-art equipment and
technology. Funds have been provided in the current financial year and for the next year.
FINANCIAL SECTOR
Banking
58. Hon’ble Members, the announcements that I made concerning the financial sector in
the Budget speech of February 2013 have been, or are being, implemented. In 2014-15, I
propose to provide `11,200 crore for capital infusion in public sector banks. They have
opened 5,207 branches so far, against the target of 8,023 branches, and are near the goal of
installing an ATM at every branch. The Bharatiya Mahila Bank was inaugurated on
19.11.2013. `6,000 crore was provided to the Rural Housing Fund and `2,000 crore to the
Urban Housing Fund.
59. Banks are under strain owing to rising non-performing assets. Bankers have assured
me that as the economy turns they will be able to contain the NPAs, recover more loans, and
build healthier balance sheets.
60. Meanwhile, I cannot fail to acknowledge the yeomen service rendered by our banks in
reaching Government’s policies and programmes to the people. This year, banks will exceed
the target of `700,000 crore of agricultural credit. I am therefore encouraged to set a target of
`800,000 crore for 2014-15. Hon’ble Members will recall that an interest subvention scheme
was introduced in 2006-07. There is a subvention of 2 percent and an incentive of 3 percent
for prompt payment, thus reducing the effective rate of interest on farm loans to
4 percent. So far, `23,924 crore has been released under the scheme. I propose to continue
the scheme in 2014-15.
Credit to Minority Communities
61. Ten years ago, the minorities had 14,15,000 bank accounts in 121 districts of India
where there is a concentration of minorities. At the end of March, 2013, they had 43,52,000
accounts and the volume of lending had soared from `4,000 crore to `66,500 crore. Loans to
minority communities in the whole country stood at `211,451 crore at the end of December
2013.
Self Help Groups
62. Ten years ago, only 9,71,182 women Self-Help Groups had been credit linked to
banks. At the end of December 2013, 41,16,000 women SHGs had been provided credit and
the outstanding amount of credit was `36,893 crore.
Education Loans
63. Ten years ago, only a few thousand students – mostly the well-connected – got
education loans. At the end of December 2013, public sector banks had 25,70,254 student
loan accounts and the amount outstanding was `57,700 crore.
64. Hon’ble Members will recall that my predecessor, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, had, in the
Budget of 2009-10, introduced the Central Scheme for Interest Subsidy (CSIS) in respect of
education loans disbursed after 1.4.2009 under which Government took over the burden of
interest for the duration of the period of study and a little beyond. The scheme brought great
cheer to student-borrowers and their families. However, I have noticed a sense of
discrimination among students who had borrowed before 31.3.2009, struggled to pay interest
during the period of study, and continued to service the loans afterwards. I think they deserve
some relief. I therefore propose a moratorium period for all education loans taken up to
31.3.2009 and outstanding on 31.12.2013. Government will take over the liability for
outstanding interest as on 31.12.2013, but the borrower would have to pay interest for the
period after 1.1.2014. It is estimated that nearly 9 lakh student borrowers will benefit to the
tune of approximately `2,600 crore. I intend to provide the funds in the current financial year
itself. Accordingly, a sum of `2,600 crore will be transferred to the Canara Bank, the
designated CSIS banker. Details of the scheme will be announced shortly.
Insurance
65. This year, Life Insurance Corporation has opened 1,252 offices and the four public
sector general insurance companies have opened 1,849 offices in towns with a population of
10,000 or more to serve peri-urban and rural areas. They are moving steadily to achieve the
goals set for them.
Financial Markets
66. A number of steps have been envisaged to deepen the Indian financial markets.
Among them are
• To comprehensively revamp the ADR/GDR scheme and enlarge the scope of
Depository Receipts;
• To liberalise the rupee-denominated corporate bond market;
• To deepen and strengthen the currency derivatives market to enable Indian
companies to fully hedge against foreign currency risks;
• To create one record for all financial assets of every individual;
• To enable smoother clearing and settlement for international investors looking
to invest in Indian bonds.
Commodity Derivatives Market
67. Hon’ble Members will recall the payment crisis in the National Spot Exchange
Limited (NSEL). Following the transfer of the subject to the Ministry of Finance, swift
action was taken to sequester NSEL and to ensure there was no spill over of the crisis to the
other regulated segments of the financial market. I propose to amend the Forward Contracts
(Regulation) Act to strengthen the regulatory framework of the commodity derivatives
market.
Key Pending Bills
68. I regret to record my disappointment that the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill and
the Securities Laws (Amendment) Bill have not been passed by Parliament for reasons that
have nothing to do with the merits of the Bills.
Public Debt Management Agency
69. Pursuant to the announcement in the Budget speech of 2011-12, Government is ready
with the Public Debt Management Agency Bill. Following precedent, it is proposed to
establish a non-statutory PDMA that can begin work in 2014-15.
A VISION FOR THE FUTURE
70. Madam Speaker, I now wish to look forward and outline a vision for the future.
71. I wonder how many have noted the fact that India’s economy, in terms of the size of
its GDP, is the 11th largest in the world. There are great things in store. There is a well-
argued view that in the next three decades India’s nominal GDP will take the country to the
third rank after the US and China. Just as the fortunes of the developed countries affect the
emerging economies today, the fortunes of China and India will, in the future, have a
significant impact on the rest of the world. We therefore owe a responsibility not only to
ourselves but to the whole world to keep our economy in robust health.
72. The UPA Government has a clear line of sight to the goals that we have set for
ourselves. I have broken down the steps toward those goals into tasks that must be
undertaken by the Government of the day. I crave your leave to identify ten such tasks:
i. Fiscal Consolidation: We must achieve the target of fiscal deficit of 3 percent
of GDP by 2016-17, and remain below that level always.
ii. Current Account Deficit: Since we will run a Current Account Deficit every
year for some more years, it can be financed only by foreign investment,
whether it is FDI or FII or ECB or any other kind of foreign inflow. Hence,
there is no room for any aversion to foreign investment.
iii. Price Stability and Growth: In a developing economy we must accept that when
our aim is high growth there will be a moderate level of inflation. RBI must
strike a balance between price stability and growth while formulating monetary
policy.
iv. Financial Sector Reforms: The recommendations of the Financial Sector
Legislative Reforms Commission that require no change in legislation must be
implemented immediately and, for the other recommendations, we must draw a
timetable for passing legislation.
v. Infrastructure: We must rebuild our infrastructure and add a huge quantity of
new infrastructure. Every proven model must be adopted and the PPP model
must be more widely used. New financing structures must be created for long
term funds and pooling of investments.
vi. Manufacturing: We must focus on manufacturing and especially on
manufacturing for export. I propose that all taxes, Central and State, that go
into an exported product should be waived or rebated. I also propose that there
should be a minimum tariff protection so that there is an incentive to
manufacture goods in India rather than import them into India.
vii. Subsidies: Given the limited resources, and the many claims on the resources,
we must choose the subsidies that are absolutely necessary and give them only
to the absolutely deserving.
viii. Urbanisation: Our cities will become ungovernable, and perhaps unliveable, if
we do not address the decay in our cities. Cities have wealth, cities also create
wealth. That wealth should be tapped for resources to rebuild the cities with a
new model of governance.
ix. Skill Development: Skill development must rank alongside secondary
education, university education, total sanitation and universal health care in the
priorities of the Government.
x. Sharing responsibility between States and Centre: States have the fiscal space
to bear a reasonable proportion of the financial costs of implementing flagship
programmes and must willingly do so, so that the Central Government can
allocate more resources for subjects such as defence, railways, national
highways and telecommunications that are its exclusive responsibility.
REVENUES
GST and DTC
73. Revenues are of paramount importance. The best source of revenue is taxes and for
that we need modern tax laws. I am disappointed that we have not yet been able to introduce
GST. I leave it to you to answer the question, who blocked the GST when an agreement on
the game-changing tax reform was around the corner? We have also got ready a Direct Taxes
Code that will serve us for at least the next twenty years. I intend to place it on the website
for a public discussion without partisanship or acrimony. I appeal to all political parties to
resolve to pass the GST laws and the DTC in 2014-15.
Funding Scientific Research
74. Our Government has passionately espoused the cause of science, promoted scientific
research, and supported scientific applications and inventions. The Income-tax Act allows
deductions for expenditure on scientific research, but it is limited to direct funding. We have
reflected on a new approach to funding scientific research. I therefore propose to set up a
Research Funding Organisation that will fund research projects selected through a
competitive process. Contributions to that organisation will be eligible for tax benefits. This
will require legislative changes which can be introduced at the time of the regular Budget.
Off-shore Accounts
75. There has been much debate on illegal off-shore accounts held by Indians.
Investigations into such accounts were launched in 2011. Despite several hurdles in
obtaining evidence from the countries concerned, the Government has succeeded, through
alternative methods and special efforts, in obtaining information in 67 cases and action is
underway to determine the tax liability as well as impose penalty. Prosecutions for wilful tax
evasion have been launched in 17 other cases. More enquiries have been initiated into
accounts reportedly held by Indian entities in no tax or low tax jurisdictions.
Changes in Tax Rates
76. In keeping with the conventions, I do not propose to make any announcements
regarding changes to the tax laws. However, the current economic situation demands some
interventions that cannot wait for the regular Budget. In particular, the manufacturing sector
needs an immediate boost. Hence, I propose the following changes in some indirect tax rates:
(i) To stimulate growth in the capital goods and consumer non-durables, I propose
to reduce the excise duty from 12 percent to 10 percent on all goods falling
under chapter 84 and chapter 85 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff
Act for the period up to 30.6.2014. The rates can be reviewed at the time of the
regular Budget.
(ii) To give relief to the automobile industry which is registering unprecedented
negative growth, I propose to reduce the excise duty as follows for the period
up to 30.6.2014:
Small cars, motor cycles, scooters
and commercial vehicles } from 12% to 8%
SUVs } from 30% to 24%
Large and mid-segment cars } from 27/24% to 24/20%
Consequently, I propose to make appropriate reductions in the excise duty on
chassis and trailers.
The rates can be reviewed at the time of the regular Budget.
(iii) To encourage domestic production of mobile handsets (which has declined) and
reduce the dependence on imports (which have increased), I propose to
restructure the excise duties for all categories of mobile handsets. The rates will
be 6 percent with CENVAT credit or 1 percent without CENVAT credit.
(iv) To encourage domestic production of soaps and oleo chemicals,
I propose to rationalise the customs duty structure on non-edible grade
industrial oils and its fractions, fatty acids and fatty alcohols at 7.5 percent.
(v) To encourage domestic production of specified road construction machinery, I
propose to withdraw the exemption from CVD on similar imported machinery.
(vi) To encourage indigenous production of security paper for printing currency
notes, I propose to provide a concessional customs duty of 5 percent on capital
goods imported by the Bank Note Paper Mill India Private Limited.
77. I also propose to give relief from service tax in two cases.
(i) By virtue of the definition of ‘agricultural produce’ in Finance Act 2012, read
with the Negative List, storage or warehousing of paddy was excluded from the
levy of service tax. Rice was not. The distinction is somewhat artificial. Hence,
I propose to exempt loading, unloading, packing, storage and warehousing of
rice from service tax.
(ii) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has requested that services provided by
cord blood banks are also healthcare services and should be exempt from
service tax. I propose to accept the request.
Notifications in respect of the above changes will be issued today.
BUDGET ESTIMATES
78. I shall now present the Budget Estimates for 2014-15.
79. The current financial year will end on a satisfactory note with the fiscal deficit at 4.6
percent (below the red line of 4.8 percent) and the revenue deficit at 3.3 percent.
80. Emboldened by the progress made, I have budgeted for receipts and expenditure in
2014-15 that will leave a fiscal deficit of 4.1 percent, which will be below the target set by
the new fiscal consolidation path. Revenue deficit is estimated at 3.0 percent.
81. The estimate of plan expenditure is `555,322 crore. Non-plan expenditure is
estimated at `12,07,892 crore.
Conclusion
82. Madam Speaker, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen have pointed out that “India was the
first non-Western country – and also the first poor country in the world – to commit itself to a
resolutely democratic way of governance.” Democracy acknowledges diversity, respects
dissent, encourages debate, and decides through a government of elected representatives.
Neither populism nor majoritarianism nor individualism is an alternative way of governance.
83. Our way of governance has not come in the way of lifting 140 million people out of
poverty in the last ten years. That is the greatest achievement of the UPA Governments, and
we are proud of the achievement.
84. In the ten years that I have been in the North Block, I have seen the best of times and
difficult times. Never did I lose faith in Jawaharlal Nehru’s idea of India that, in the words of
Sunil Khilnani, “sought to coordinate within the form of a modern state a variety of values:
democracy, religious tolerance, economic development and cultural pluralism.” It is with
that faith that I shall remain on the bridge until the day when, I am sure, the people of India
will entrust the responsibility to a hand that will hold the “sceptre swayed with equity.” Let
me sign off with the couplet from the sage, Thiruvalluvar:
“Vel Anru Venri Tharuvathu Mannavan
Kol Athuvoom Kodaathu Enin.”
(Not the spear but sceptre swayed with equity
Alone gives the ruler victory.)
85. Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Interim Budget to the House.

Budget 2007-2008
Speech of
P. Chidambaram
Minister of Finance
February 28, 2007
Mr. Speaker, Sir
It is my privilege to present the Budget for 2007-08.
I. A MID-TERM REPORT CARD ON THE ECONOMY
2. In November 2006, the UPA Government crossed the midpoint of its
term of office. A midterm report card can now be presented. There are many
pluses and a few minuses, and I shall deal with both candidly. The biggest plus is
that the growth rate of GDP has improved from 7.5 per cent in 2004-05 to 9 per
cent (Quick Estimate) in 2005-06 and, according to Advance Estimate, to 9.2
per cent in 2006-07. The average growth rate in the three years of the UPA
Government is, therefore, 8.6 per cent. Thanks to this impressive performance,
despite the poor start in 2002-03, the growth target set for the Tenth Plan of 8 per
cent will be nearly achieved.
3. Manufacturing is the main driver of growth, and this augurs well for the
future. In the three years of the UPA Government, the growth rate in manufacturing
has accelerated from 8.7 per cent to 9.1 per cent and further to 11.3 per cent. The
services sector continues to maintain impressive growth and has recorded, in the
three years, a growth rate of 9.6 per cent, 9.8 per cent and 11.2 per cent
respectively.
4. On the other hand, the agriculture sector has witnessed sharp ups and
downs. Average growth during the Tenth Plan period is estimated at 2.3 per cent,
which is below the desired level of 4 per cent a year. About 115 million families
are classified as farming families. Furthermore, a country with a large population
has to be nearly self-sufficient in essential food items; otherwise supply constraints
could upset macro economic stability and growth prospects. Hence, agriculture
must top the agenda of the policy makers and must hold the first charge on our
resources. In a short while, I shall place before this House a number of proposals
in this regard.
2
Income and Savings
5. To continue with the report card, per capita income in 2005-06, in real
terms, increased by 7.4 per cent, and the savings rate has been estimated at 32.4
per cent and the investment rate at 33.8 per cent. Intuitively, I believe that these
high rates have continued in the current year too.
6. The UPA Government has remained committed to economic reforms,
fiscal prudence and monetary stability.
7. Revenues are buoyant for the third year in succession. We have garnered
additional revenues and, as Honourable Members will notice presently, I have
put these revenues to good use to promote inclusive growth, equity and social
justice - goals that are at the core of the National Common Minimum Programme
(NCMP) and close to the hearts of the UPA, its Chairperson and the Prime
Minister.
Outlook on Inflation
8. Until February 2, 2007, bank credit, year on year, had grown by 29.6 per
cent. Money supply (M3) had expanded by 21.3 per cent. Foreign exchange
reserves stood at US$ 180 billion. While these are concomitant features of high
growth, it cannot be denied that these monetary trends have put pressure on
prices. Global commodity prices have also exerted pressure on domestic prices.
At the same time, supply constraints have emerged in some essential commodities
such as wheat, pulses and edible oils. Consequently, average inflation in
2006-07 is estimated at between 5.2 and 5.4 per cent, which is higher than 4.4
per cent last year. I wish to reiterate Government's concern over inflation.
Government has already taken a number of measures on the fiscal, monetary and
supply sides to maintain price stability and, if required, will not hesitate to take
more measures. When the UPA Government assumed office in 2004, the inflation
graph was on the rise; but we succeeded in moderating inflation and we are
confident that we can moderate the present inflationary trend too.
II. BHARAT NIRMAN AND THE FLAGSHIP PROGRAMMES
9. Bharat Nirman remains the cornerstone of the Government's policy. I am
glad to report that in the current financial year:
• Additional irrigation potential of 2,400,000 hectares, including
900,000 hectares under AIBP, will be created;
• Drinking water has been provided to 55,512 habitations until
December 2006 against a target of 73,120 habitations;
• Until December 2006, 12,198 kilometres of rural roads have been
completed. The separate window under RIDF will augment funds
for the programme by Rs.4,000 crore a year;
• 783,000 rural houses have been constructed up to December 2006
and 914,000 houses are under construction, and the annual target of
1,500,000 houses is likely to be exceeded;
3
• 19,758 villages have been covered so far under the Rajiv Gandhi
Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana;
• 15,054 villages have been provided with a telephone against the
target of 20,000 villages, and the balance will be covered by the end
of the year;
Honourable Members will note that Bharat Nirman continues to make impressive
progress.
10. The eight flagship programmes of the UPA Government will continue to
receive high priority. Presently, I shall refer to these programmes in some detail.
III. HERALDING THE ELEVENTH FIVE YEAR PLAN
11. The year 2007-08 will mark the beginning of the Eleventh Plan. The
declared objective is "Faster and More Inclusive Growth". I can state with
confidence that, on the eve of the Plan, the economy is in a stronger position
than ever before. It therefore behoves us to set higher goals. The Approach Paper
to the Eleventh Plan states that the Plan "will aim at putting the economy on a
sustainable growth trajectory with a growth rate of approximately 10 per cent by
the end of its period." Among the other objectives of the Plan are growth of 4 per
cent in the agriculture sector, faster employment creation, reducing disparities
across regions and ensuring access to basic physical infrastructure as well as
health and education services to all. I have kept these objectives in mind while
allocating resources to various sectors.
Gross Budgetary Support
12. Notwithstanding some constraints, I propose to increase substantially
the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) for the Plan. In 2006-07, the GBS was fixed
at Rs.172,728 crore and, of this, support to the Central Plan was Rs.131,284
crore. GBS for 2007-08 will be increased to Rs.205,100 crore. Out of this, the
Central Plan will receive Rs.154,939 crore.
Allocations for Major Sectors
13. For Bharat Nirman, as against Rs.18,696 crore (including the NER
component) in 2006-07, I propose to provide Rs.24,603 crore in 2007-08, which
marks an increase of 31.6 per cent.
14. The education and health sectors will also receive substantial funds. In
2007-08, I propose to enhance the allocation for education by 34.2 per cent to
Rs.32,352 crore and for health and family welfare by 21.9 per cent to Rs.15,291
crore.
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Mid-day Meal Scheme
15. In allocating resources, school education must have primacy. Hence, I
propose to increase the allocation for school education by about 35 per cent
from Rs.17,133 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.23,142 crore in 2007-08.
16. Out of this amount, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) will be provided
Rs.10,671 crore. Further, I propose to increase the provision for strengthening
4
teachers training institutions from Rs.162 crore to Rs.450 crore. Next year, we
will appoint 200,000 more teachers and construct 500,000 more class rooms.
17. The Mid-day Meal Scheme will be provided Rs.7,324 crore next year. In
addition to covering children in primary classes, beginning 2007-08, we propose
to cover children in upper primary classes in 3,427 educationally backward blocks.
18. The transfer to Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh will increase from Rs.8,746
crore to Rs.10,393 crore.
19. As more students complete upper primary classes, it is necessary to
increase access to secondary education. Schemes for this purpose are under
formulation, and I propose to double the provision for secondary education from
Rs.1,837 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.3,794 crore in 2007-08.
Means-Cum-Merit Scholarships
20. While the SSA has improved the enrolment ratio in schools to 96 per
cent, the drop out ratio continues to be high. The critical year appears to be
transition from class VIII to class IX. In order to arrest the drop out ratio and
encourage students to continue their education beyond class VIII, I propose to
introduce a National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme. Selection will be
made through a national test from among students who have passed class VIII.
Each student will be given Rs.6,000 per year for study in classes IX, X, XI and
XII. I propose that 100,000 scholarships may be awarded every year. In order to
fund this programme, I intend to create a corpus fund of Rs.750 crore this year,
and add a like amount to the fund every year over the next three years. Accordingly,
a sum of Rs.750 crore will be placed with the State Bank of India, and the yield
from the fund will be used for awarding the scholarships.
Drinking Water and Sanitation
21. 55,512 habitations and 34,000 schools have been provided drinking water
supply till December, 2006 under the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission.
More ambitious targets have been set for 2007-08 to deal with both non-coverage
and slippage. I propose to enhance the allocation for the Mission from Rs.4,680
crore in 2006-07 to Rs.5,850 crore in 2007-08.
22. As regards the Total Sanitation Campaign, I propose to increase the
provision from Rs.720 crore this year to Rs.954 crore next year.
Health Sector; National Rural Health Mission
23. In the second year of its implementation, the National Rural Health
Mission (NRHM) is on schedule to meet its timelines. The institutional integration
of all the health schemes at the district and lower levels has been achieved. All
districts in the country will complete preparation of District Health Action Plans
by March 2007. The major emphasis will be on mother and child care and on the
prevention and treatment of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and
malaria. Through Monthly Health Days (MHD) organised at Anganwadi centres,
convergence is sought to be achieved among various programmes such as
immunization, ante natal care as well as nutrition and sanitation.
5
24. I am happy to report that 320,000 Associated Social Health Activists
(ASHAs) have been recruited and over 200,000 have received orientation training.
Besides, 90,000 link workers have been selected by the States. With trained
ASHAs in place, I am confident there will be significant improvement in health
care in rural areas. The Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Sidha and
Homeopathy (AYUSH) systems are also being mainstreamed into the health
delivery system at all levels. I propose to increase the allocation for NRHM
from Rs.8,207 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.9,947 crore in 2007-08.
HIV/AIDS
25. Government has brought HIV/AIDS out of the closet and promised bold
and determined efforts to achieve zero-level growth of the disease. The epidemic
will be deemed 'stabilised' if the prevalence rate is less than one per cent of the
population. National Aids Control Programme (NACP)-III, starting in 2007-08
and building on NACP-I and NACP-II, will target the high risk groups in all the
States. We will expand access to condoms and ensure universal access to blood
screening and safe blood. More hospitals will provide treatment to prevent
transmission of HIV/AIDS from mother to child. Support will be given to the
protocol on paediatric dosage developed by Indian doctors and launched in
November 2006. For the year 2007-08, I propose to step up the provision for the
AIDS control programme to Rs.969 crore.
Polio
26. Last year, I had expressed the hope that polio will be eliminated from the
country by December 2007. However, there was an outbreak in western Uttar
Pradesh in early 2006. The strategy for polio eradication has been revised. The
number of polio rounds will be increased, monovalent vaccine will be introduced,
and there will be intensive coverage in the 20 high risk districts of Uttar Pradesh
and 10 districts of Bihar. The programme has been integrated into the NRHM.
The ASHAs and the Anganwadi workers will visit every household and track
every child for the immunization programme. To achieve the goal of eliminating
polio, I propose to provide Rs.1,290 crore in 2007-08.
Integrated Child Development Services
27. In the second phase of expansion of the Integrated Child Development
Services (ICDS), Government has sanctioned 173 ICDS projects, 107,274
Anganwadi centres and 25,961 mini-Anganwadi centres. Government is
committed to expand the scheme in order to cover all habitations and settlements
during the Eleventh Plan and to reach out to pregnant women, lactating mothers
and all children below the age of six. I propose to increase the allocation for
ICDS from Rs.4,087 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.4,761 crore in 2007-08.
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
28. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) was
launched on February 2, 2006. The pace of implementation varies from State to
State. Since NREGS is a demand-driven scheme carrying a legal guarantee of
employment, the budget allocation would have to be supplemented according to
6
need. I therefore propose to make an initial allocation of Rs.12,000 crore
(including NER component) for NREGS. I am also happy to announce that
NREGS will be expanded from the current level of 200 districts to 330 districts.
In addition, I have provided Rs.2,800 crore for Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojana
(SGRY) for rural employment in the districts not covered by NREGS.
29. Swaranjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) is intended to promote
self-employment among the rural poor through Self Help Groups (SHG). I propose
to strengthen this programme by increasing the allocation from Rs.1,200 crore
in the current year to Rs.1,800 crore (including NER component) next year.
Urban Unemployment
30. The issue of urban unemployment and poverty alleviation is equally
critical. Hence, I propose to increase the allocation for Swarna Jayanti Shahari
Rojgar Yojana from Rs.250 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.344 crore next year.
Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission
31. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) has
evoked a positive response from State Governments. As on date, 538 projects
with a total cost of Rs.23,950 crore have been sanctioned in sectors such as
water supply, sanitation, transport, road and housing in many cities spread over
several States. I propose to enhance the allocation from Rs.4,595 crore in
2006-07 to Rs.4,987 crore 2007-08.
Targeted Public Distribution System and Antyodaya Anna Yojana
32. The issue prices of food grains under the Public Distribution System
(PDS) and for the beneficiaries of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana have been retained.
A Plan scheme for evaluation, monitoring, management and strengthening of
the targeted PDS will be implemented in 2007-08, and this will include
computerisation of the PDS and an integrated information system in the Food
Corporation of India.
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
33. Continuing the practice that was started in 2005-06, a separate statement
on the schemes for the welfare of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes
(STs) is placed in the Budget documents. The allocation in 2007-08 for SCs and
STs has been substantially enhanced. In respect of schemes benefiting only SCs
and STs, I have increased the allocation to Rs.3,271 crore. In respect of schemes
with at least 20 per cent of the benefits earmarked for SCs and STs, I have
increased the allocation to Rs.17,691 crore.
34. SC and ST students studying in M.Phil and PhD courses are supported
by the Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship Programme. I propose to enhance the
allocation from Rs.35 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.88 crore in 2007-08.
Post-Matric Scholarships
35. There is a post-matric scholarship programme for SC and ST students. I
propose to increase the provision for these scholarships from Rs.440 crore in
7
2006-07 to Rs.611 crore in 2007-08. I also propose to make a separate provision
of Rs.91 crore for similar scholarships to be awarded to students belonging to
socially and educationally backward classes.
Minorities
36. Last year, I made a modest contribution of Rs.16.47 crore to the equity of
the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC).
Following the Sachar Committee report, NMDFC would be required to expand
its reach and intensify its efforts. Hence, I propose to provide a further sum of
Rs.63 crore to the share capital of NMDFC.
37. There are a number of districts with a concentration of minorities. I
propose to make a provision of Rs.108 crore for a multi-sector development
programme in these districts.
38. Three scholarship programmes are being implemented for students
belonging to minority communities. I propose to make the following allocations:
Pre-matric scholarships Rs.72 crore
Post-matric scholarships Rs.90 crore
Merit-cum-Means scholarships at
graduate and post-graduate levels Rs.48.60 crore
Women
39. There is growing awareness of gender sensitivities of budgetary
allocations. 50 ministries/departments have set up gender budgeting cells. For
2007-08, 27 ministries/departments and 5 Union Territories covering 33 demands
for grants have contributed to a statement placed in the budget papers. The outlay
for 100 per cent women specific programmes is Rs.8,795 crore and for schemes
where at least 30 per cent is for women specific programmes is Rs.22,382 crore.
We have made a sincere effort to remove the errors that were pointed out in last
year's statement.
North Eastern Region (NER)
40. The total budget allocation in 2007-08 for the North Eastern Region,
culled out from allocations under different ministries/ departments, has increased
from Rs.12,041 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.14,365 crore in 2007-08. This includes
Rs.1,380 crore provided to the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region
(DONER). The new industrial policy for NER, with suitable fiscal incentives,
will be in place before March 31, 2007.
Supplement to the GBS
41. I have, so far, outlined the allocations under what may be called Plan 'A'
which has a resource basket of Rs.205,100 crore. In consultation with the
Planning Commission, I have also drawn up Plan 'B'. Since the Eleventh Plan
will begin on April 1, 2007, we recognize that there will be a need to take new
initiatives in critical areas. Additional resources will be needed once the proposals
are finalised and the pace of expenditure builds up. Therefore, I shall endeavour
to find additional resources through better tax administration to the extent of
8
Rs.7,000 crore during the course of the year. I have been advised by the Planning
Commission that these additional funds, once voted by this House, will be
allocated among sectors such as agriculture, rural development, health, women
and child development, urban infrastructure, water resources, etc.
42. I also have Plan 'C'. Under Plan 'C', I propose to tap into resources available
outside the Budget and leverage them for the purpose of investment, especially
in the infrastructure sector. I shall deal with this subject a little later.
IV. AGRICULTURE
43. I shall now take up our main challenge: agriculture. I may recall the
words of Jawaharlal Nehru, who said "Everything else can wait, but not
agriculture".
44. The draft National Policy for Farmers submitted by the National
Commission on Farmers is under consideration. Meanwhile, I have a number of
proposals to improve the economic viability of farming and ensure that farmers
earn a minimum net income.
Farm Credit
45. Farm credit continues to grow at a satisfactory pace. The goal of doubling
farm credit in three years was achieved in two years. The target of Rs.175,000
crore set for 2006-07 will be exceeded comfortably and is likely to reach
Rs.190,000 crore. This year, until December 2006, 53.37 lakh new farmers were
brought into the institutional credit system. For 2007-08, I propose to fix a target
of Rs.225,000 crore as farm credit and an addition of 50 lakh new farmers to the
banking system.
46. The two per cent interest subvention scheme for short-term crop loans
will continue in 2007-08, and I am making a provision of Rs.1,677 crore for that
purpose.
47. A special plan is being implemented over a period of three years in 31
especially distressed districts in four States of the country involving a total amount
of Rs.16,979 crore. Of this, about Rs.12,400 crore will be on water related
schemes. In order to provide subsidiary income to the farmer, the special plan
includes a scheme for induction of high yielding milch animals and related
activities. I propose to provide Rs.153 crore for this scheme.
Agricultural Indebtedness
48. Government had appointed a Committee under Dr. R. Radhakrishna to
examine all aspects of agricultural indebtedness. The Committee has held wide
ranging consultations across the country and is in the process of finalising its
recommendations. Government will act on the report as soon as it is received.
A Mission for Pulses
49. Government is concerned about the stagnation in the production and
productivity of pulses. A critical deficiency is the availability and quality of
certified seeds. I therefore propose to expand the Integrated Oilseeds, Oil palm,
9
Pulses and Maize Development programme. There will be a sharper focus on
scaling up the production of breeder, foundation and certified seeds. The Indian
Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR), Kanpur, the National and State level seeds
corporations, agricultural universities, ICAR centres, KRIBHCO, IFFCO and
NAFED as well as large private sector companies will be invited to submit plans
to scale up the production of seeds. Government will fund the expansion of
IIPR, Kanpur, and offer the other producers a capital grant or concessional
financing in order to double the production of certified seeds within a period of
three years.
Plantation Sector
50. A Special Purpose Tea Fund has been launched for re-plantation and
rejuvenation of tea. Government will soon put in place similar financial
mechanisms for coffee, rubber, spices, cashew and coconut.
Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme
51. The Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) has been revamped
in order to complete more irrigation projects in the quickest possible time. 35
projects are likely to be completed in 2006-07 and additional irrigation potential
of 900,000 hectares will be created. As against an outlay of Rs.7,121 crore in
2006-07, the outlay for 2007-08 will be increased to Rs.11,000 crore. Of this,
the grant component to State Governments will be Rs.3,580 crore, an increase
from Rs.2,350 crore.
Rainfed Area Development Programme
52. The National Rainfed Area Authority was established a few months ago
to coordinate all schemes relating to watershed development and other aspects
of land use. I propose to allocate Rs.100 crore for the new Rainfed Area
Development Programme.
Water Resources Management: Restoring Water Bodies
53. Honourable Members will recall that, in March 2005, a pilot project to
repair, renovate and restore water bodies was launched in 13 States. I am happy
to inform the House that the World Bank has signed a loan agreement with Tamil
Nadu for Rs.2,182 crore to restore 5,763 water bodies having a command area
of 400,000 hectares. An agreement for Andhra Pradesh is expected to be concluded
in March 2007 and will cover 3,000 water bodies with a command area of 250,000
hectares. Preparation of similar projects for Karnataka, Orissa and West Bengal
are at different stages and at least two more agreements are likely to be concluded
before June 2007. I would urge other State Governments to come forward with
proposals so that the whole country can be covered within the next two years.
Ground Water Recharge
54. Depletion of ground water has assumed grave proportions. The Central
Ground Water Board has identified 1,065 assessment blocks in the country as
'over-exploited' or 'critical'. Over 80 per cent of these blocks are in 100 districts
in seven States. The strategy for ground water recharge is to divert rain water
10
into 'dug wells'. Each structure will cost about Rs.4,000. The requirement is
seven million structures, including about two million structures on land belonging
to small and marginal farmers. I propose to provide 100 per cent subsidy to
small and marginal farmers and 50 per cent subsidy to other farmers. Ministry of
Water Resources will finalise the scheme shortly. In anticipation, I intend to
transfer a sum of Rs.1,800 crore to NABARD. The amount will be held in escrow
and will be disbursed through the lead bank of the district concerned to the
beneficiaries.
Training of Farmers
55. With minimum instruction and training, our farmers will easily absorb
good water management practices. I therefore propose that the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research (ICAR) may set up one teaching-cum-demonstration model
of water harvesting in each of 32 selected State Agricultural Universities and
ICAR institutes. Each institution will train 100 trainers and 1,000 farmers every
year in two-week and one-week programmes respectively. Based on estimates
of recurring costs, I intend to provide an interest free loan of Rs.3 crore to each
institution to create a corpus fund. The yield from the fund will be used for
implementing the training programme. The total cost is estimated at Rs.100 crore.
Extension System
56. The green revolution of the 1960s was brought about by thousands of
agricultural extension workers who worked side by side with our farmers under
a programme called Training and Visit (T&V). Sadly, the extension system seems
to have collapsed. In order to revive extension work, the Ministry of Agriculture
will, in consultation with State Governments, draw up a new programme that
will replicate T&V with suitable changes.
57. The Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA) that is now
in place in 262 districts will be extended to another 300 districts in 2007-08. I
propose to enhance the provision for ATMA from Rs.50 crore to Rs.230 crore
next year.
Fertiliser Subsidies
58. I had budgeted Rs.17,253 crore for fertiliser subsidies in 2006-07.
According to Revised Estimates, this will rise to Rs.22,452 crore, and there is a
demand for more money. While fertilisers should indeed be subsidised, we must
find an alternative method of delivering the subsidy directly to the farmer. The
fertiliser industry has agreed to work with the Department of Fertilisers to conduct
a study and find a solution. Based on the report, Government intends to implement
a pilot programme in at least one district in each State in 2007-08.
Agricultural Insurance
59. The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) will be continued
in its present form for Kharif and Rabi 2007-08. I propose to make a provision of
Rs.500 crore for the scheme.
11
60. Agricultural Insurance Corporation (AIC) has been running a pilot weather
insurance scheme since Kharif 2004 and it appears to be a more promising risk
mitigation scheme. Hence, Government will ask AIC to start a weather based
crop insurance scheme on a pilot basis in two or three States, in consultation
with the State Governments concerned, as an alternative to the NAIS. The scheme
will be operated on an actuarial basis with an element of subsidy. I intend to
allocate Rs.100 crore for this purpose in 2007-08.
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)
61. NABARD provides refinance to cooperative institutions. As the volume
of farm credit increases and the Vaidyanathan Committee recommendations for
reform of rural credit cooperatives are implemented, the demand for refinance
will increase. In order to augment its resources, I propose to allow NABARD to
issue rural bonds to the extent of Rs.5,000 crore. These bonds will be guaranteed
by the Government and will be eligible for suitable tax exemption.
Rural Infrastructure Development Fund
62. The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) continues to sanction
and disburse funds to State Governments. In 2006-07, out of a corpus of Rs.10,000
crore, NABARD has so far issued sanctions for Rs.8,440 crore and will achieve
its target. Keeping in view the growing demand for these funds, I propose to
raise the corpus of RIDF-XIII in 2007-08 to Rs.12,000 crore. I would urge State
Governments to use these funds primarily in the distressed districts of the State.
63. A separate window for rural roads under RIDF was opened with Rs.4,000
crore. Against this, projects for Rs.2,311 crore have been sanctioned in 2006-07.
I propose to continue the separate window under RIDF-XIII in 2007-08 with a
corpus of Rs.4,000 crore.
Social Security
64. One of the commitments made in the NCMP is that Government will
introduce a social security scheme for unorganised workers. A committee chaired
by Dr. Arjun Sengupta has given its report which is under consideration. Pending
a decision, in order to signal the UPA Government's concern for the welfare of
unorganised workers, I propose to make a beginning. I propose to extend death
and disability insurance cover through Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
to rural landless households under a new scheme called 'Aam Admi Bima Yojana'
(AABY). According to NSS Report No. 491, the estimate of such households is
about 1.5 crore. By end March 2007, 70 lakh households will be covered through
existing schemes of the LIC with the support of some State Governments and
the social security fund with the LIC. Under AABY, I propose to cover the rural
landless households which enjoy no cover at all today, and the number may be
actually more than what is indicated in the NSS report. The head of the family or
one earning member in the family will be insured. The Central Government will
bear 50 per cent of the premium of Rs.200 per year per person and I would urge
the State Governments to come forward to bear the other 50 per cent on behalf
of the beneficiaries. Taking into account the annual cost to the Central
12
Government, I intend to place a sum of Rs.1,000 crore in a fund that will be
maintained by LIC. I propose to finalise the scheme in consultation with State
Governments and begin to implement it in 2007-08.
65. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have devoted the last 15 minutes or so to agriculture.
There is no dearth of schemes; there is no dearth of funds. What needs to be
done is to deliver the intended outcomes. Saint Tiruvalluvar watches over us and
warns:-
“Uzhavinar Kai Madangin Illai Vizhaivathoom
Vittame Enbarkum Nilai”
[If ploughmen keep their hands folded
Even sages claiming renunciation cannot find salvation]
V. INVESTMENT
66. All indicators point to an accelerating rate of investment in the economy.
For example, gross domestic capital formation (GDCF) in 2005-06 grew by 23.7
per cent over the previous year to Rs.11,47,254 crore. I believe that this trend
continues in 2006-07. In April-January, 2006-07, foreign direct investment
amounted to US$12.5 billion and outpaced portfolio investment which was
US$6.8 billion.
67. Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) will, through internal and extra
budgetary resources, invest Rs.165,053 crore in 2007-08. Government will
provide equity support of Rs.16,361 crore and loans of Rs.2,970 crore to CPSEs.
68. Further, in the current year, we have restructured eight CPSEs with a
cash infusion of Rs.1,590 crore and non-cash sacrifices of Rs.1,612 crore.
VI. INFRASTRUCTURE
Power
69. Electricity generation has recorded a growth rate of 7.5 per cent in April-
December this year. However, as we complete the Tenth Plan, we would have
added only 23,163 MW of additional capacity in the five year period including
16,339 MW added in the three years beginning 2004-05. Hence, it is imperative
that we take new initiatives.
70. The Ministry of Power has awarded two Ultra Mega Power Projects
(UMPP) in Sasan and Mundra. Seven more UMPPs are under process and we
are confident that at least two more will be awarded by July, 2007. Other initiatives
taken by the Ministry of Power include facilitating setting up of merchant power
plants by private developers and private participation in transmission projects.
71. Besides, the Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Project
(APDRP) has reduced significantly Aggregate Technical and Commercial (ATC)
losses in 213 towns. APDRP is being restructured to cover all district headquarters
13
and towns with a population of more than 50,000. I propose to increase the
budgetary support for APDRP from Rs.650 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.800 crore
next year.
Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana
72. Having regard to the pace of implementation under the Rajiv Gandhi
Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana and the annual target, I propose to increase the
allocation from Rs.3,000 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.3,983 crore in 2007-08.
Coal
73. Following the announcement last year, 26 coal blocks with reserves of
8,581 million tonnes and four lignite blocks with reserves of 755 million tonnes
have been allotted, up to December 2006, to Government companies and approved
end users. The definition of specified end use will be enlarged to include
underground coal gasification and coal liquefaction.
National Highways
74. Work on the golden quadrilateral is nearly complete and there is
considerable progress in the North-South, East-West corridor project which is
expected to be completed by 2009. NHDP-III, NHDP-V and NHDP-VI are in
advanced stages of planning or implementation. So far, National Highways
Authority of India (NHAI) has given Rs.2,072 crore as viability gap funding but
has also received Rs.1,900 crore as negative grant. The private sector investment
leveraged under NHDP is Rs.25,366 crore. Under the programme for the North
Eastern Region (SARDP-NE), 450 kilometres have been awarded in 2006-07
and the balance will be awarded in 2007-08. I propose to increase the provision
for the National Highway Development Programme (NHDP) from Rs.9,945 crore
in 2006-07 to Rs.10,667 crore next year.
75. The road-cum-rail bridge at Munger, Bihar, over the Ganga, has been
taken up as a national project. Likewise, the road-cum-rail bridge at Bogibeel,
Assam, over the Brahmaputra, will be taken up as a national project.
Public Private Partnership and Viability Gap Funding
76. The Public Private Partnership (PPP) model has enabled greater private
sector participation in the creation and maintenance of infrastructure. So far,
under the viability gap funding scheme, 37 proposals have been received of
which 21 proposals have been granted 'in-principle' approval with a total project
cost of Rs.9,842 crore and an estimated viability gap funding of Rs.2,521 crore.
The pace is slow, and there is a need to adopt a more aggressive approach for
preparing a shelf of bankable projects that can be offered for competitive bidding.
Apart from the steps already taken for capacity building and engaging consultants,
I intend to set up a revolving fund with a corpus of Rs.100 crore to quicken
project preparation. The fund will contribute up to 75 per cent of the preparatory
expenditure in the form of interest free loan that will be eventually recovered
from the successful bidder. Guidelines for operating the fund will be announced
in due course.
14
VII. INDUSTRY
Petroleum and Natural Gas
77. Energy security is high on the Government's agenda. In the six rounds of
New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) so far, 162 production sharing
contracts have been awarded. Indian and foreign companies have already made
an investment of Rs.97,000 crore in exploration. Similarly, after three rounds of
bidding, 23 coal bed methane blocks have been awarded for exploration.
Textiles
78. A rejuvenated textile industry is geared to meet the global challenge. 26
parks have been approved so far out of 30 sanctioned under the Scheme for
Integrated Textiles Parks (SITP). I propose to increase the provision for these
parks from Rs.189 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.425 crore in 2007-08.
79. I am also glad to announce that the Technology Upgradation Fund (TUF)
scheme will be continued during the Eleventh Plan. Against a provision of Rs.535
crore in 2006-07, I propose to provide Rs.911 crore in 2007-08. As before,
handlooms will be covered under the TUF scheme.
Handlooms
80. A cluster approach for the development of the handloom sector was
introduced in 2005-06 and 120 clusters have been selected. 273 new yarn depots
have been opened in the current year and the Handloom Mark was launched.
Government proposes to take up an additional 100-150 clusters in 2007-08. The
12 schemes that are now implemented will be grouped into five schemes in the
Eleventh Plan period. The health insurance scheme has so far covered 300,000
weavers and will be extended to more weavers. The scheme will also be enlarged
to include ancillary workers. I propose to enhance the allocation for the sector
from Rs.241 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.321 crore next year.
Small and Medium Enterprises
81. Following the credit policy for small and medium enterprises (SME)
announced in August 2005, outstanding credit to the SME sector increased from
Rs.135,200 crore at end December 2005 to Rs.173,460 crore at end December
2006. While encouraging banks to lend more to the SME sector, I propose to ask
banks to have regard to the credit rating acquired by an SME while fixing the
interest rate.
Coir Industry
82. Coir is an eco-friendly fibre. The coir industry provides employment to a
large number as well as earns valuable foreign exchange. I am happy to announce
a scheme for the modernisation and technology upgradation of the coir industry
with special emphasis to major coir producing States such as Kerala, Karnataka,
Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. I propose to make a provision of
Rs.22.50 crore.
15
VIII. SERVICES SECTOR
Foreign Trade
83. Our merchandise exports crossed the milestone of US$100 billion in
2005-06 and are expected to cross another milestone of US$125 billion by the
end of the current fiscal. Foreign trade is growing at a rate more than twice the
growth rate of GDP. Government will continue to follow export friendly policies.
Tourism
84. I propose to increase the provision for building tourist infrastructure from
Rs.423 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.520 crore in 2007-08.
IX. FINANCIAL SECTOR
Banking
85. In addition to the important legislative measures now before Parliament,
Government proposes to take a number of initiatives in banking and insurance.
86. Government proposes to acquire RBI's equity holding in State Bank of
India. I have provided a sum of Rs.40,000 crore for this purpose, but the
transaction will be deficit neutral to the Government.
87. The Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) scheme provides finance at a rate
of 4 per cent to the weaker sections of the community engaged in gainful
occupations. I propose to raise the limit of the loan from Rs.6,500 to Rs.15,000
and the limit of the housing loan from Rs.5,000 to Rs.20,000 per beneficiary.
Regional Rural Banks
88. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) have emerged as the third arm for
delivering rural credit, and the sponsor banks have assured me that RRBs are
willing to take on greater responsibilities. The Committee on Financial Inclusion,
chaired by Dr. C. Rangarajan, has also made certain recommendations concerning
RRBs. I, therefore, propose to:
• ask RRBs to undertake an aggressive branch expansion programme
and, in 2007-08, open at least one branch in the 80 uncovered districts
of the country;
• extend the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
Enforcement of Securitisation of Interest (SARFAESI) Act to loans
advanced by RRBs;
• permit RRBs to accept NRE/FCNR deposits; and
• recapitalize, in a phased programme, the RRBs which have a negative
net worth.
Housing Loans
89. The National Housing Bank (NHB) will shortly introduce a novel product
for senior citizens: a 'reverse mortgage' under which a senior citizen who is the
owner of a house can avail of a monthly stream of income against the mortgage
of his/her house, while remaining the owner and occupying the house throughout
his/her lifetime, without repayment or servicing of the loan.
16
90. Our people want housing loans. Banks and housing finance companies
that lend against mortgages would have greater comfort if the mortgage can be
guaranteed through a three way contract among borrower, lender and guarantor.
Regulations will be put in place to allow the creation of mortgage guarantee
companies.
Insurance
91. On December 6, 2006, Rashtrapatiji launched an exclusive health
insurance scheme for senior citizens offered by National Insurance Company. I
have asked the other three public sector insurance companies to offer a similar
product to senior citizens, and they have agreed to do so in 2007-08.
92. The Micro Financial Sector (Development and Regulation) Bill as well
as a comprehensive Bill to amend the insurance laws will be introduced in the
Budget Session.
Financial Inclusion
93. Financial inclusion is the process of ensuring access to timely and adequate
credit and financial services by vulnerable groups at an affordable cost. The
Committee on Financial Inclusion has given an interim report. While we await
the final report, Government has decided to implement, immediately, two
recommendations. The first is to establish a Financial Inclusion Fund with
NABARD for meeting the cost of developmental and promotional interventions.
The second is to establish a Financial Inclusion Technology Fund to meet the
costs of technology adoption. Each fund will have an overall corpus of Rs.500
crore, with initial funding to be contributed by the Central Government, RBI and
NABARD.
Capital Markets
94. The capital market is an important instrument for intermediating financial
resources. Recognising the strength of the Indian capital market, the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has decided to hold its annual
conference in Mumbai in April 2007. In line with measures announced every
year to strengthen the market, I propose to:
• make PAN the sole identification number for all participants in the
securities market with an alpha-numeric prefix or suffix to distinguish
a particular kind of account;
• take forward the idea of Self Regulating Organisations (SRO) for
different market participants under regulations that will be made by
SEBI and, if necessary, supported by an enabling law;
• promote the flow of investment to the infrastructure sector by
permitting mutual funds to launch and operate dedicated
infrastructure funds;
• converge the different regulations that allow individuals and Indian
mutual funds to invest in overseas securities by permitting individuals
to invest through Indian mutual funds;
17
• allow short selling settled by delivery, and securities lending and
borrowing to facilitate delivery, by institutions;
• put in place an enabling mechanism to permit Indian companies to
unlock a part of their holdings in group companies for meeting
their financing requirements by issue of Exchangeable Bonds.
Innovative Financing for Infrastructure
95. The minimum obligation of States to borrow from the National Small
Savings Fund (NSSF) has been brought down to 80 per cent of net collections.
Repayments of past NSSF loans by the Central and State Governments have
also commenced from 2005-06, making available resources for long-term lending.
I therefore propose that these funds may also be borrowed from NSSF by India
Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL).
96. An initiative that has borne fruit is the launch of the US$5 billion
infrastructure financing initiative by Citigroup, Blackstone, IDFC and IIFCL.
97. A committee chaired by Shri Deepak Parekh has made a number of
recommendations for financing infrastructure. One of the recommendations is
to use a small part of the foreign exchange reserves without the risk of monetary
expansion. The Committee has suggested the establishment of two wholly-owned
overseas subsidiaries of IIFCL with the following objectives:
(i) to borrow funds from the RBI and lend to Indian companies
implementing infrastructure projects in India, or to co-finance their
ECBs for such projects, solely for capital expenditure outside India;
and
(ii) to borrow funds from the RBI, invest such funds in highly rated
collateral securities, and provide 'credit wrap' insurance to
infrastructure projects in India for raising resources in international
markets.
The loans by RBI to these two subsidiary companies will be guaranteed by the
Government of India and the RBI will be assured of a return higher than the
average rate of return on its incremental investment. Government proposes to
examine the legal and regulatory aspects of the recommendation, in consultation
with RBI, in order to find an innovative method of enhancing the financial
resources for infrastructure.
X. OTHER PROPOSALS
Defence Expenditure
98. I propose to increase the allocation for Defence to Rs.96,000 crore. This
will include Rs.41,922 crore for capital expenditure. Needless to say, any
additional requirement for the security of the nation will be provided.
Information Technology
99. Government has launched an ambitious programme for e-governance.
The goal is to improve efficiency, convenience, accessibility and transparency in
18
Government functions and take Government services to the common citizen.
I propose to increase the allocation for e-governance from Rs.395 crore in
2006-07 to Rs.719 crore in 2007-08. The Central Government supports
e-governance action plans at State levels, and I propose to increase the allocation
for such support from Rs.300 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.500 crore in 2007-08. I also
propose to provide Rs.33 crore for a new scheme of manpower development for
the software export industry.
Backward Regions Grant Fund
100. The Backward Regions Grant Fund received Rs.5,000 crore in 2006-07.
I propose to increase the allocation to Rs.5,800 crore in 2007-08. This will finance
two components, one pertaining to 250 districts and the other pertaining to the
special plan for Bihar. KBK districts of Orissa, which are included in the 250
districts, will continue to receive the same quantum of assistance as they have
been receiving in the past.
Mumbai as a Financial Centre
101. The High Powered Expert Committee to make Mumbai a regional
financial centre has submitted its report recently. I intend to place the report in
the public domain and obtain feedback. It is my hope that we would be able to
build a consensus on the key recommendations of the Committee, promote a
world class financial centre in Mumbai, and realise the objective of making
'financial services' the next growth engine for India.
Vocational Education Mission
102. To sustain a high level of economic growth, it is essential to have a
reservoir of skilled and trained manpower. Shortages have already emerged in a
number of sectors. Moreover, we can take advantage of the demographic dividend
thrown up by an increase in the working age population only if our young men
and women have the required skills. The Prime Minister spoke of a Vocational
Education Mission in his Independence Day address in 2006. A taskforce in the
Planning Commission is chalking out strategies for vocational education
programmes. Alternate models may be adopted, but the approach will be based
on public-private partnership. I propose to make an initial provision of Rs.50
crore for beginning work on this mission.
Upgradation of ITIs
103. Honourable Members will recall that Government had taken up a
programme for upgradation of 500 ITIs over five years beginning 2005. Revised
courses in the first lot of 100 upgraded ITIs were started in August 2005 and in
the second lot of 100 upgraded ITIs in August 2006. I expect that another 300
ITIs will be covered by August 2009. That would still leave 1,396 Government
ITIs.
104. I propose that the 1,396 ITIs be upgraded into centres of excellence in
specific trades and skills under public-private partnership. Under the proposed
scheme, the State Government, as the owner of the ITI, will continue to regulate
admissions and fees; the new management will be given academic and financial
19
autonomy; and the Central Government will provide financial assistance by way
of seed money. ITIs will be encouraged to start a second shift. Once a tripartite
MoU is signed among the three stakeholders, I propose to grant an interest free
loan up to Rs.2.5 crore to each ITI for upgradation and revision of courses. I seek
the cooperation of State Governments in upgrading at least 300 ITIs every year,
beginning 2007-08, under the PPP mode. I have kept aside Rs.750 crore for this
purpose.
Employment for the Physically Challenged
105. Among the disadvantaged sections of the society are physically challenged
persons. They face difficulties in obtaining regular employment. In order to
incentivise employers in the organised sector to provide regular employment, I
propose a scheme whereunder Government will reward the employer once the
physically challenged employee is regularised and is enrolled under the Employees
Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees State Insurance (ESI). Under the
scheme, Government will reimburse the employer's contribution to the EPF and
ESI for the first three years. Government is ready to support the creation of
about 100,000 jobs every year for physically challenged persons with a salary
limit of Rs.25,000 per month. I estimate the cost to Government at Rs.150 crore
per annum rising to Rs.450 crore per annum when the scheme is fully rolled out.
I have therefore earmarked Rs.1,800 crore.
Debt Management Office
106. World over, debt management is distinct from monetary management.
The establishment of a Debt Management Office (DMO) in the Government has
been advocated for quite some time. The fiscal consolidation achieved so far has
encouraged us to take the first step. Accordingly, I propose to set up an autonomous
DMO and, in the first phase, a Middle Office will be set up to facilitate the
transition to a full-fledged DMO.
Development Cooperation
107. In keeping with India's growing stature in international affairs, we must
willingly assume greater responsibility in promoting development in other
developing countries. At present, India extends development cooperation through
a number of Ministries and agencies and the total sum is about US$ 1 billion per
annum. It is felt that all activities relating to development cooperation should be
brought under one umbrella. Accordingly, Government proposes to establish the
India International Development Cooperation Agency (IIDCA). The Ministries
of External Affairs, Finance and Commerce and other stakeholders will be
represented on IIDCA.
Climate Change
108. India is not a significant contributor to green house gas (GHG) emissions,
nor will it be so in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, in line with the principle
of "common but differentiated responsibility", India has taken important steps
to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate change impact. India has also
strongly promoted the clean development mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto
20
Protocol and has the world's largest number of CDM projects. Nevertheless,
India is among the countries more vulnerable to climate change. Hence,
Government proposes to appoint an expert committee to study the impact of
climate change on India and identify the measures that we may have to take in
the future.
Commonwealth Games
109. India bid for and won for the city of Delhi the Commonwealth Games
2010. The nation was filled with pride when, under the guidance of Shri Rajiv
Gandhi, we successfully hosted the Asian Games in 1982. We owe it to our
people to make the Commonwealth Games an equally memorable event. I propose
to provide in 2007-08 Rs.150 crore to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports
and Rs.350 crore to the Delhi Government for the Games. Similarly, I propose to
provide Rs.50 crore for the Commonwealth Youth Games 2008 to be held in
Pune.
History and Culture
110. As we celebrate the 150th year of the First War of Independence and the
centenary year of the Satyagraha Movement, our thoughts go to the institutions
that continue the work of Gandhiji and other constructive work. I intend to set
apart Rs.30 crore for four institutions whose work we gratefully acknowledge.
These are Sabarmati Ashram, Ahmedabad; Sevagram Ashram, Wardha;
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune; and Rajendra Smriti Sanghrahalaya,
Patna. I also intend to provide Rs.20 crore to reposition the Nehru Memorial
Museum and Library, Delhi, as a major centre of intellectual activity.
111. The Ministry of Culture proposes to engage scholars from Indian and
foreign institutions to work on specific projects. The terms of engagement will
provide freedom and flexibility to the scholars. I intend to make an initial grant
of Rs.5 crore to encourage this effort.
Institutions of Excellence
112. As in the last two years, I propose to make a special grant of Rs.100 crore
to recognise excellence. Government has selected the Govind Ballabh Pant
University of Agriculture & Technology, Pantnagar and the Tamil Nadu
Agricultural University, Coimbatore, and each will be given Rs.50 crore.
XI. PUBLIC FINANCE
113. Thanks to the Fiscal Responsibility legislations, the Central Government
and the State Governments have regained lost fiscal ground. Rs. 110,268 crore
of States' debt has been consolidated. Twenty States have availed of the benefit
of debt waiver to the tune of Rs.8,575 crore.
114. In 2006-07, the Centre will give to the States as their share of taxes and
duties Rs.120,377 crore. In 2007-08, this amount will increase to Rs.142,450
crore. Besides, total grants and loans, both under Plan and non-Plan, to States
and Union Territories will increase from Rs.90,521 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.106,987
crore in 2007-08.
21
VAT, CST and a Roadmap towards GST
115. VAT has proved to be an unqualified success. VAT revenues of the
implementing States increased by 13.8 per cent in 2005-06 and by 24.3 per cent
in the first nine months of 2006-07. The next logical step is to phase out Central
Sales Tax (CST). I am glad to report that the Central Government has reached an
agreement with State Governments to phase out CST. Consequently, the CST
rate will be reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent with effect from April 1, 2007.
I have provided Rs.5,495 crore for compensation for losses, if any, on account
of VAT and also on account of CST.
116. I wish to record my deep appreciation of the spirit of cooperative
federalism displayed by State Governments and especially their Finance Ministers.
At my request, the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers has agreed
to work with the Central Government to prepare a roadmap for introducing a
national level Goods and Services Tax (GST) with effect from April 1, 2010.
117. So far as the Central Government is concerned, the fiscal consolidation
is proceeding according to the FRBM Act. Based on Revised Estimates, I am
happy to report that the revenue deficit for the current year will be 2.0 per cent
(against a BE of 2.1 per cent) and the fiscal deficit will be 3.7 per cent (against a
BE of 3.8 per cent).
XII. BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 2007-08
118. I turn to the Budget Estimates for 2007-08.
Plan Expenditure
119. I estimate Plan expenditure for 2007-08 at Rs.205,100 crore. As a
proportion of total expenditure (net of the SBI share acquisition), Plan expenditure
will be 32.0 per cent.
Non-Plan Expenditure
120. Non-Plan Expenditure in 2007-08 (net of the SBI share acquisition) is
estimated at Rs.435,421. The increase over 2006-07 is only 6.5 per cent.
Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit
121. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates for 2007-08, the total
expenditure is estimated at Rs.680,521 crore (including Rs.40,000 crore for the
SBI share acquisition). The total revenue receipts of the Central Government are
projected to be Rs.486,422 crore and the revenue expenditure to be Rs.557,900
crore. Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs.71,478 crore which is
1.5 per cent of the GDP. The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs.150,948 crore,
which is 3.3 per cent of the GDP. I am happy to report that we are on course to
achieve the FRBMA targets.
22
Part - B
XIII. TAX PROPOSALS
122. Mr. Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals.
123. The UPA Government promised that "tax rates will be stable and
conducive to growth, compliance and investment". The increase in gross tax
revenue is proof of a promise fulfilled. While we have raised more tax revenue,
we have also left more money in the hands of the people as savings and for
investment.
124. Gross tax revenue has grown by 19.9 per cent, 20.0 per cent and 27.8 per
cent in the first three years of this Government. The tax to GDP ratio has increased
from 9.2 per cent in 2003-04 to 11.4 per cent in 2006-07. We intend to keep our
tax rates moderate and stable and administer the tax laws in a tax payer-friendly
manner.
Indirect Taxes
125. I shall begin with indirect taxes. Firstly, customs duties.
126. In January 2007, Government announced wide ranging reductions in
tariffs. Import duties on capital goods, project imports, metals and specified
inorganic chemicals were reduced by 2.5 percentage points and, in some cases,
by 5 percentage points. Duties on some edible oils were reduced by 10 to 12.5
percentage points.
127. In order to take one more step towards comparable East Asian rates, I
propose to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 12.5 per cent
to 10 per cent.
128. I propose to reduce the duties on most chemicals and plastics from 12.5
per cent to 7.5 per cent.
129. The duty on prime steel is 5 per cent. Seconds and defectives augment
supply. Keeping in mind the need for a differential, I propose to reduce the duty
on seconds and defectives of steel from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.
130. I propose to fully exempt from duty all coking coal irrespective of the
ash content.
131. Last year, I reduced the excise duty on all man-made fibres and yarns
from 16 per cent to 8 per cent. To further encourage this industry, I propose to
reduce the customs duty on polyester fibres and yarns from 10 per cent to 7.5 per
cent. Consequently, the customs duty on raw-materials such as DMT, PTA and
MEG will also be reduced from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
132. Another industry that is a growth- and employment- driver is gem and
jewellery. I propose to bring down the duty on cut and polished diamonds from
23
5 per cent to 3 per cent; on rough synthetic stones from 12.5 per cent to 5 per
cent; and on unworked corals from 30 per cent to 10 per cent.
133. I propose to fully exempt dredgers from import duty.
134. To augment irrigation facilities and processing of agricultural products, I
propose to reduce the duty on drip irrigation systems, agricultural sprinklers and
food processing machinery from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.
135. While specified medical equipment attract a concessional duty of 5 per
cent, other equipment are taxed at 12.5 per cent. I propose to bring down the
general rate of import duty on medical equipment to 7.5 per cent.
136. In order to make edible oils more affordable, I propose to exempt crude
as well as refined edible oils from the additional CV duty of 4 per cent. I also
propose to reduce the duty on sunflower oil, both crude and refined, by 15
percentage points.
137. I have good news for cat and dog lovers. I propose to reduce the duty on
pet foods from 30 per cent to 20 per cent.
138. I propose to reduce the duty on watch dials and movements as well as
umbrella parts from 12.5 per cent to 5 per cent.
139. In order to promote research and development, I propose to extend the
concessional rate of 5 per cent duty available to public funded research institutions
to all research institutions registered with the Directorate of Scientific and
Industrial Research. For the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector, I propose
to reduce the duty on 15 specified machinery from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.
140. Import of aircraft, including helicopters, by Government and scheduled
airlines is, at present, exempt from all duties, and that position will continue.
However, there is no reason to allow the exemption to other private importers.
Hence, I propose to levy an import duty of 3 per cent, which is the WTO bound
rate, on all private import of aircraft including helicopters. Such import will also
attract countervailing duty and additional customs duty.
141. The Hoda Committee has submitted a report on mineral policy. Taking a
leaf out of the report, and in order to conserve our natural resources as well as to
raise revenue, I propose to impose an export duty of Rs.300 per metric tonne on
export of iron ores and concentrates and Rs.2,000 per metric tonne on export of
chrome ores and concentrates.
142. I shall now turn to my proposals on excise duties and service tax.
143. There will be no change in the general CENVAT rate or in the service tax
rate.
24
144. On February 15, 2007, Government reduced the price of petrol and diesel
by Rs.2 per litre and Re.1 per litre, respectively. I had agreed that the Revenue
will bear a part of the burden. Hence, I propose to reduce the ad valorem
component of excise duty on petrol and diesel from 8 per cent to 6 per cent.
145. Keeping in mind the special needs of several sectors and the interest of
the consumers, I propose to grant relief from excise duty in deserving cases,
especially job creating sectors:
• I propose to raise the exemption limit for small scale industry (SSI)
from Rs.1 crore to Rs.1.5 crore.
• The food processing sector is poised to achieve high growth.
Concessions were extended last year to several items of food. This
year, I propose to fully exempt from excise duty biscuits whose retail
sale price does not exceed Rs.50 per kilogram. I also propose to
fully exempt from excise duty all kinds of food mixes including
instant mixes. I can no longer be accused of being partial to idli and
dosa mixes.
• I propose to reduce excise duty on umbrellas and parts of footwear
from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.
• Plywood helps to save wood. Hence, I propose to reduce excise duty
on plywood from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.
• Biodiesel will greatly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Hence,
I propose to fully exempt biodiesel from excise duty.
146. To provide access to pure drinking water for households and communities,
I propose to fully exempt from excise duty water purification devices operating
on specified membrane based technologies as well as domestic water filters not
using electricity.
147. Pipes used for carrying water from a water supply plant to a storage facility
are exempt from excise duty. I propose to extend the exemption to all pipes of
diameter exceeding 200 mm used in water supply systems.
148. There has been a significant increase in the retail price of cement. Last
year, at this time, a bag of 50 kilogram was sold at a Maximum Retail Price
(MRP) of Rs.190 or less which, I understand, is a remunerative price. I propose
to reward cement manufacturers who hold the price line and tax those who do
not. Accordingly, I propose to reduce the present rate of excise duty of Rs.400
per metric tonne to Rs.350 per metric tonne on cement which is sold in retail at
not more than Rs.190 per bag. On cement that has a higher MRP, the excise duty
will be Rs.600 per metric tonne.
149. I strongly support the campaign "say no to tobacco". Hence, I propose to
increase the specific rates of excise duty on cigarettes by about 5 per cent.
Similarly, excise duty (excluding cess) on biris, which was last fixed in 2001,
25
will be raised from Rs.7 to Rs.11 per thousand for non-machine made biris and
from Rs.17 to Rs.24 per thousand for machine made biris. There is an exemption
from excise duty for unbranded biris up to 20 lakh biris in a year. Complaints
have been received of misuse of the exemption. This exemption will henceforth
be available subject to fulfilment of the condition of declaration with the
Department of Central Excise and regular monitoring.
150. Pan masala containing tobacco will continue to bear an excise duty of 66
per cent. However, in the case of pan masala not containing tobacco, the duty
will be reduced from 66 per cent to 45 per cent. I also propose to withdraw the
exemption for pan masala containing tobacco and other tobacco products that is
now given to units in the North Eastern States.
151. Based on a comprehensive review of exemptions and having posted them
on the website and having invited comments, I propose to remove certain excise
duty exemptions which are redundant or have outlived their utility.
152. I propose to raise the exemption limit for small service providers from
Rs.400,000 to Rs.800,000. Consequently, 200,000 assessees out of a total of
400,000 assessees will go out of the service tax net. The revenue loss will be
Rs.800 crore, but I am happy to give away this sum in the interest of the small
service provider and the consumer.
153. While I bid goodbye to 200,000 assessees, I welcome the new assessees
who will be brought into the fold. I propose to extend service tax to:
• Services outsourced for mining of mineral, oil or gas;
• Renting of immovable property for use in commerce or business;
however, residential properties, vacant land used for agriculture and
similar purposes, land for sports, entertainment and parking purposes,
and immovable property for educational or religious purposes will
be excluded;
• Development and supply of content for use in telecom and advertising
purposes;
• Asset management services provided by individuals; and
• Design services.
154. State Governments levy a tax on the transfer of property in goods involved
in the execution of a works contract. The value of services in a works contract
should attract service tax. Hence, I propose to levy service tax on services involved
in the execution of a works contract. However, I also propose an optional
composition scheme under which service tax will be levied at only 2 per cent of
the total value of the works contract.
155. I propose to exempt service tax on services provided by Resident Welfare
Associations to their members who contribute Rs.3000 or less per month for
services rendered.
26
156. In order to encourage innovation, I propose to exempt from service tax
all services provided by technology business incubators. Similarly, their
incubatees whose annual business turnover does not exceed Rs.50 lakhs will be
exempt from service tax for the first three years.
157. To make India a preferred destination for drug testing, I propose to exempt
clinical trial of new drugs from service tax.
158. The scope of some services that are currently taxed is being expanded or
redefined. However, I shall not burden the House with the details.
159. The telecommunications industry has repeatedly requested that the
multifarious taxes, charges and fees applicable to the industry should be unified
and a single levy on revenue should be collected. The request merits consideration.
Hence, I propose to request the Department of Telecommunications to constitute
a committee to study the present structure of levies and make suitable
recommendations to Government.
Direct Taxes
160. I shall now move to direct taxes.
161. In the current year, there has been better tax compliance by individuals. I
hope this trend will continue.
162. The current slabs and rates of personal income tax (PIT) were introduced
only two years ago. They constitute a moderate tax regime. A comprehensive
review should await the proposed Income Tax code which will be introduced in
Parliament this year. Nevertheless, without altering the rates, I am inclined to
consider giving some relief to tax payers, especially in view of the cooperation
they have extended to the Department of Revenue. Accordingly, I propose that:
• the threshold limit of exemption in the case of all assessees be
increased by Rs.10,000, thus giving every assessee a relief of
Rs.1,000;
• consequently, in the case of a woman assessee, the threshold limit
be increased from Rs.135,000 to Rs.145,000, giving her a relief of
Rs.1,000;
• the threshold limit of exemption in the case of a senior citizen be
increased from Rs.185,000 to Rs.195,000, giving him or her a relief
of Rs.2,000; and
• the deduction in respect of medical insurance premium under section
80D be increased to a maximum of Rs.15,000 and, in the case of a
senior citizen, a maximum of Rs.20,000.
163. On the corporate income tax (CIT) side too, there has been better
compliance. Consequently, I propose to keep the same rate of CIT with one
important modification. In order to encourage small and medium enterprises to
27
invest and grow, I propose to remove the surcharge on income tax on all firms
and companies with a taxable income of Rs.1 crore or less. This will benefit
about 1,200,000 firms and companies.
164. Profit-making cooperative banks, other than primary societies and primary
banks (i.e., PACs and PCARDBs), have been brought on par with other banks.
However, I have noticed some anomalies and I propose to correct them in the
interest of the cooperative banks. Accordingly, the benefit of Section 36(1)(viii)
will be available to cooperative banks. Likewise, cooperative banks will also be
allowed deduction in respect of provision for bad and doubtful debts under section
36(1)(viia). Amalgamation and de-merger of banking companies is tax neutral
and this benefit will be extended to cooperative banks.
165. Section 80IA of the Income Tax Act lists the infrastructure facilities that
are entitled to tax concessions. There are some obvious claimants to this benefit.
One is cross country natural gas distribution network, including gas pipeline and
storage facilities integrated to the network. The second is navigation channel in
the sea. I propose to extend the tax concession to these two facilities.
166. In order to facilitate the creation of urban infrastructure, I propose to
allow issue of tax-free bonds through State Pooled Finance Entities formed for
raising funds for a group of urban local bodies.
167. Last year, I had constituted an expert body to advise the Government on
tax policy in respect of the gem and jewellery industry. Taking into account its
recommendations, the best international practices and the need for a simple tax
regime, I propose to introduce a benign assessment procedure for assessees
engaged in diamond manufacturing and trading who declare profits from such
activities at 8 per cent or more of the turnover. Instructions in this regard will
issue shortly.
168. We will require 20,000 more hotel rooms for the Commonwealth Games.
Hence, I propose a five year holiday from income tax for two, three or four star
hotels as well as for convention centres with a seating capacity of not less than
3,000. They should be completed and begin operations in the National Capital
Territory of Delhi or in the adjacent districts of Faridabad, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad
or Gautam Budh Nagar during the period April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2010.
169. Section 35(2AB) allows a weighted deduction of 150 per cent for
expenditure relating to in-house research and development. I propose to extend
the concession for five more years until March 31, 2012.
170. Undertakings in Jammu & Kashmir presently enjoy a tax holiday that is
due to end on March 31, 2007. Considering the importance of promoting further
investment in that State, I propose to extend the benefit for another five years up
to March 31, 2012.
28
171. E-filing of corporate returns introduced this financial year has been a
resounding success. Until January 31, 2007, 301,736 returns were electronically
filed by corporates. Our analysis shows that the effective rate of tax paid by all
corporates, thanks to numerous tax concessions and exemptions - several of
them well-intended - was only 19.2 per cent. In 1996-97, we introduced the
Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) for companies with book profits, and its purpose
is to bring about horizontal equity in taxation. MAT should therefore apply, as
far as possible, to all corporate incomes. Hence, I propose to extend MAT to
income in respect of which deduction is claimed under sections 10A and 10B of
the Income Tax Act.
172. I also propose to partially modify a deduction that is available to certain
companies. Without altering the overall limit of the special reserve equal to twice
the net worth under section 36(1)(viii) of the Income Tax Act, I propose to stretch
out the period by restricting the deduction to 20 per cent of the profits each year
and limit the benefit to banks and certain financial corporations.
173. Venture capital funds are a useful source of risk capital, especially for
start-up ventures in the knowledge-intensive sectors. Since such funds enjoy a
pass-through status, it is necessary to limit the tax benefit to investments made
in truly deserving sectors. Accordingly, I propose to grant pass-through status to
venture capital funds only in respect of investments in venture capital undertakings
in biotechnology; information technology relating to hardware and software
development; nanotechnology; seed research and development; research and
development of new chemical entities in the pharmaceutical sector; dairy industry;
poultry industry; and production of bio-fuels. In order to promote business
tourism, I also propose to allow this benefit to venture capital funds that invest
in hotel-cum-convention centres of a certain description and size.
174. In December 2006, I put a limit of Rs.50 lakh per investor per year with
respect to capital gains bonds issued by NHAI and REC under section 54EC of
the Income Tax Act. As a result, many small investors could obtain these bonds
and save on capital gains. I propose to continue this provision and, accordingly,
I propose to amend section 54EC to that effect.
175. I propose to expand the tax base of capital gains to include certain works
of art.
176. I believe that my direct tax proposals have brought about more horizontal
equity. It is also necessary to improve vertical equity. Having regard to the capacity
to pay, I propose to raise the rate of dividend distribution tax from 12.5 per cent
to 15 per cent on dividends distributed by companies.
177. Dividends distributed by money market mutual funds and liquid mutual
funds enjoy concessional tax rates giving rise to huge arbitrage opportunities. I
propose to address this distortion by raising the dividend distribution tax on
dividends paid by such entities to 25 per cent for all investors.
29
178. Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) has now stabilized. I have received a few
representations regarding some aspects of sales promotion. Hence, I propose to
clarify the doubts by excluding expenditure on free samples as well as expenditure
on displays from the scope of FBT.
179. A number of companies provide fringe benefits to employees through
Employees' Stock Option Plan (ESOP). I propose to bring ESOPs under FBT.
The value of the fringe benefit will be determined, in accordance with a prescribed
method, on the date of exercise of the option.
180. The Banking Cash Transactions Tax (BCTT) continues to be an extremely
useful tool to track unaccounted monies and trace their source and destination. It
has led the Income Tax Department to many money laundering and hawala
transactions. Having regard to the experience gained, I propose to exclude cash
withdrawals by the Central and State Governments from the scope of BCTT.
Further, I propose to raise the exemption limit for individuals and HUFs from
Rs.25,000 to Rs.50,000. As other instruments become more effective, I think it
would be possible to review BCTT next year.
181. I have a proposal regarding the cess for education. While the cess of 2
per cent on all taxes to fund basic education will remain, I propose to levy an
additional cess of 1 per cent on all taxes to fund secondary education and higher
education and the expansion of capacity by 54 per cent for reservation for socially
and educationally backward classes.
182. Finally, there is a small matter which has large beneficial consequences.
In 2001, 'Aviation Turbine Fuel sold to turbo-prop aircraft' was included in the
list of declared goods under section 14 of the CST Act. Turbo-prop aircraft have
been replaced by new generation small aircraft which have taken air services to
smaller airports and to the remote parts of the country. Hence, I propose to amend
the provision to cover all small aircraft with maximum takeoff mass of less than
40,000 kgs operated by scheduled airlines.
183. Along with tax reforms, the Government has laid great emphasis on tax
administration. The cost of collection of taxes in India is among the lowest in the
world. A number of administrative goals have been set for 2007-08. These include
expanding the coverage of Annual Information Returns, extending the Refund
Banker System to more areas, extending the e-payment facility through more
banks, making electronic filing of returns mandatory for more categories of
assessees and creating new Large Tax Payer Units.
184. My tax proposals on direct taxes are estimated to yield a gain of Rs.3,000
crore. On the indirect taxes side, the proposals are revenue neutral.
30
XIV. CONCLUSION
185. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our human and gender development indices are low not
because of high growth but because growth is not high enough. Faster economic
growth has given us, once again, the opportunity to unfurl the sails and catch the
wind. Without growth, I could not have given a new thrust to agriculture. I could
not have given relief to the small tax payer, the small service provider and to
small scale industry. I could not have promised 100,000 scholarships or 100,000
jobs for the physically challenged. I could not have promised a massive ground
water recharge programme or social security for rural landless households.
186. The UPA Government has delivered on the promise of savings and
investment, and will deliver on the promise of encouraging more savings and
translating the savings into more investment. It has delivered on the promise of
growth, and will deliver on the promise of making growth more inclusive. I
believe that, given a right mix of policies, the poor will benefit from growth that
is driven by savings and investment and that is more inclusive. As Dr. Muhammad
Yunus, the Nobel laureate, said, “Faster growth rate is essential for faster reduction
in poverty. There is no other trick to it.”
187. Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House.

Budget 2014-2015
Speech of
Arun Jaitley
Minister of Finance
July 10, 2014
Madam Speaker,
I rise to present the Budget for the year 2014-15.
I. STATE OF THE ECONOMY
2. The people of India have decisively voted for a change. The verdict
represents the exasperation of the people with the status-quo. India unhesitatingly
desires to grow. Those living below the poverty line are anxious to free themselves
from the curse of poverty. Those who have got an opportunity to emerge from
the difficult challenges have become aspirational. They now want to be a part of
the neo middle class. Their next generation has the hunger to use the opportunity
that society provides for them. Slow decision making has resulted in a loss of
opportunity. Two years of sub five per cent growth in the Indian economy has
resulted in a challenging situation. We look forward to lower levels of inflation
as compared to the days of double digit rates of food inflation in the last two
years. The country is in no mood to suffer unemployment, inadequate basic
amenities, lack of infrastructure and apathetic governance.
3. The slowdown in India broadly reflects the trend in many economies. In
contrast to the aftermath of the crisis of 2008-09 when restoration of growth in
advanced economies was the primary concern, the continuing slowdown being
presently witnessed in many emerging economies has posed a threat to a sustained
global recovery. Fortunately, there are green shoots of recovery being seen in the
global economy. As per IMF, the world economy is projected to grow at 3.6 per
cent in 2014 vis-à-vis 3.0 per cent in 2013, with the Euro area expected to register
a positive growth after the contraction witnessed in 2012 and 2013. However,
the performance of the US economy with attendant implication for the
unconventional monetary policy stance and global financial conditions is pivotal
to the fate of global recovery in the coming years. These are the head winds
2
against which the Indian economy would have to maneuver its way to attain
high growth trajectory.
4. As Finance Minister I am duty bound to usher in a policy regime that
will result in the desired macro-economic outcome of higher growth, lower
inflation, sustained level of external sector balance and a prudent policy stance.
The Budget is the most comprehensive action plan in this regard. In the first
Budget of this NDA government that I am presenting before the august House,
my aim is to lay down a broad policy indicator of the direction in which we wish
to take this country. The steps that I will announce in this Budget are only the
beginning of a journey towards a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent or above
within the next 3-4 years along with macro-economic stabilization that includes
lower levels of inflation, lesser fiscal deficit and a manageable current account
deficit. Therefore, it would not be wise to expect everything that can be done or
must be done to be in the first Budget presented within forty five days of the
formation of this Government.
5. While higher growth is a sine qua non, we cannot be oblivious of the fact
that there is a large population of this country which is below the poverty line. It
is the poor who suffer the most. We have to ensure that our anti-poverty programs
are well targeted. The growing aspirations of the people will be reflected in the
development strategy followed by the Government led by the Prime Minister
Shri Narendra Modi and its mandate of “Sab ka Saath Sab ka Vikas”. Allow me
to assure this House that we have taken up the challenge in the right earnest. We
shall leave no stone unturned in creating a vibrant and strong India.
6. The prevailing economic situation presents a great challenge. It calls for
a conscious choice to be made by all of us. Should we allow this drift to carry on
and watch helplessly? Should we allow our future to suffer because of our
indecisiveness? Should we be victims of mere populism or wasteful expenditure?
To me, the response and the remedy are both clear. The task before me today is
very challenging because we need to revive growth, particularly in manufacturing
and infrastructure to raise adequate resources for our developmental needs. On
the other hand, the task is simple if we accept the principle that we cannot spend
beyond our means. We need to introduce fiscal prudence that will lead to fiscal
consolidation and discipline. Fiscal prudence to me is of paramount importance
because of considerations of inter-generational equity. We cannot leave behind a
legacy of debt for our future generations. We cannot go on spending today which
would be financed by taxation at a future date. There is an urgent need to generate
more resources to fuel the economy. For this, the tax to GDP ratio must be
improved and non-tax revenues increased. We must remember that the decline
in fiscal deficit from 5.7 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 to 4.8 per cent in 2012-13
3
and 4.5 per cent in 2013-14 was mainly achieved by reduction in expenditure
rather than by way of realization of higher revenue. Although, the external sector
witnessed a turn-around with the year ending with a Current Account Deficit of
1.7 per cent of the GDP against 4.7 per cent in 2012-13, this was mainly achieved
through restriction on non-essential imports and slowdown in overall aggregate
demand. Going forward, we must continue to be watchful of the CAD.
7. My predecessor has set up a very difficult task of reducing fiscal deficit
to 4.1 per cent of the GDP in the current year. Considering that we had two years
of low GDP growth, an almost static industrial growth, a moderate increase in
indirect taxes, a large subsidy burden and not so encouraging tax buoyancy, the
target of 4.1 per cent fiscal deficit is indeed daunting. Difficult, as it may appear,
I have decided to accept this target as a challenge. One fails only when one stops
trying. My Road map for fiscal consolidation is a fiscal deficit of 3.6 per cent for
2015-16 and 3 per cent for 2016-17. I am conscious of the fact that Iraq crisis is
leaving an impact on oil prices and the situation in the middle-east continues to
be volatile. Monsoon this year appears more unpredictable. While inflation has
remained at elevated levels relative to what is perceived as acceptable, there has
been a gradual moderation in WPI recently, from a high of 7.35% in 2012-13
and 5.98% in 2013-14. But we are still not out of the woods. We also must
address fully the problem of black money which is curse of our economy. Faced
with these adversities we have no option but to undertake some bold steps in
order to enhance economic activity and spur growth in the economy. These steps
are only the beginning of our effort to revive the growth spirit of the Indian
Economy. They are directional.
Expenditure Management Commission
8. My Government is committed to the principle of “Minimum Government
Maximum Governance”. To achieve this goal, time has come to review the
allocative and operational efficiencies of Government expenditure to achieve
maximum output. The Government will constitute an Expenditure Management
Commission, which will look into various aspects of expenditure reforms to be
undertaken by the Government. The Commission will give its interim report
within this financial year. I also propose to overhaul the subsidy regime, including
food and petroleum subsidies, and make it more targeted while providing full
protection to the marginalized, poor and SC/STs. A new urea policy would also
be formulated.
GST
9. The debate whether to introduce a Goods and Services Tax (GST) must
now come to an end. We have discussed the issue for the past many years. Some
4
States have been apprehensive about surrendering their taxation jurisdiction;
others want to be adequately compensated. I have discussed the matter with the
States both individually and collectively. I do hope we are able to find a solution
in the course of this year and approve the legislative scheme which enables the
introduction of GST. This will streamline the tax administration, avoid harassment
of the business and result in higher revenue collection both for the Centre and
the States. I assure all States that government will be more than fair in dealing
with them.
Tax Administration
10. The sovereign right of the Government to undertake retrospective
legislation is unquestionable. However, this power has to be exercised with
extreme caution and judiciousness keeping in mind the impact of each such
measure on the economy and the overall investment climate. This Government
will not ordinarily bring about any change retrospectively which creates a fresh
liability. Hon’ble Members are aware that consequent upon certain retrospective
amendments to the Income Tax Act 1961 undertaken through the Finance Act
2012, a few cases have come up in various courts and other legal fora. These
cases are at different stages of pendency and will naturally reach their logical
conclusion. At this juncture I would like to convey to this August House and also
the investors community at large that we are committed to provide a stable and
predictable taxation regime that would be investor friendly and spur growth.
Keeping this in mind, we have decided that henceforth, all fresh cases arising
out of the retrospective amendments of 2012 in respect of indirect transfers and
coming to the notice of the Assessing Officers will be scrutinized by a High
Level Committee to be constituted by the CBDT before any action is initiated in
such cases. I hope the investor community both within India and abroad would
repose confidence on our stated position and participate in the Indian growth
story with renewed vigour.
Advance Ruling and Other Tax Related Measures
11. Tax demand of more than ` 4 lakh crore is under dispute and litigation
before various Courts and Appellate authorities. This is one of the serious concerns
of all taxpayers in this country. In order to reduce litigation in direct taxes,
I propose to make certain legislative and administrative changes.
12. Currently, an advance ruling can be obtained about the tax liability of a
non-resident from the Authority for Advance Rulings. This facility is not available
to resident taxpayers except Public Sector Undertakings. I propose to enable
resident taxpayers to obtain an advance ruling in respect of their income tax
liability above a defined threshold. I also propose to strengthen the Authority for
Advance Rulings by constituting additional benches. I further propose to enlarge
5
the scope of the Income-tax Settlement Commission so that taxpayers may
approach the Commission for settlement of disputes. This would continue to be
once in a lifetime opportunity for any taxpayer.
13. As an administrative measure, I propose to set up a High Level Committee
to interact with trade and industry on a regular basis and ascertain areas where
clarity in tax laws is required. Based on the recommendations of the Committee,
the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board of Excise and Customs
shall issue appropriate clarifications, wherever considered necessary, on the tax
issues within a period of two months.
14. Transfer Pricing is a major area of litigation for both resident and non-
resident taxpayers. I have proposed certain changes in the Transfer Pricing
regulations, which I would spell out in Part-B of my speech.
15. I hope these measures would go a long way in improving the confidence
of taxpayers in the tax system and would provide certainty and clarity in tax
laws.
FDI
16. The policy of the NDA Government is to promote Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) selectively in sectors where it helps the larger interest of the
Indian Economy. FDI in several sectors is an additionality of resource which
helps in promoting domestic manufacture and job creation. India today needs a
boost for job creation. Our manufacturing sector in particular needs a push for
job creation.
17. India today is the largest buyer of Defence equipment in the world. Our
domestic manufacturing capacities are still at a nascent stage. We are buying
substantial part of our Defence requirements directly from foreign players.
Companies controlled by foreign governments and foreign private sector are
supplying our Defence requirements to us at a considerable outflow of foreign
exchange. Currently we permit 26 per cent FDI in Defence manufacturing. The
composite cap of foreign exchange is being raised to 49 per cent with full Indian
management and control through the FIPB route.
18. The Insurance sector is investment starved. Several segments of the
Insurance sector need an expansion. The composite cap in the Insurance sector
is proposed to be increased up to 49 per cent from the current level of 26 per
cent, with full Indian management and control, through the FIPB route.
19. To encourage development of Smart Cities, which will also provide
habitation for the neo-middle class, requirement of the built up area and capital
conditions for FDI is being reduced from 50,000 square metres to 20,000 square
metres and from USD 10 million to USD 5 million respectively with a three year
post completion lock in.
6
20. To further encourage this, projects which commit at least 30 per cent of
the total project cost for low cost affordable housing will be exempted from
minimum built up area and capitalisation requirements, with the condition of
three year lock-in.
21. FDI in the manufacturing sector is today on the automatic route. The
manufacturing units will be allowed to sell its products through retail including
E-commerce platforms without any additional approval.
Bank Capitalization
22. Financial stability is the foundation of a rapid recovery. Our banking
system needs to be further strengthened. To be in line with Basel-III norms there
is a requirement to infuse ` 2,40,000 crore as equity by 2018 in our banks. To
meet this huge capital requirement we need to raise additional resources to fulfill
this obligation. While preserving the public ownership, the capital of these banks
will be raised by increasing the shareholding of the people in a phased manner
through the sale of shares largely through retail to common citizens of this country.
Thus, while the government will continue to have majority shareholding, the
citizens of India will also get direct shareholding in these banks, which currently
they hold indirectly. We will also examine the proposal to give greater autonomy
to the banks while making them accountable.
PSU Capital Expenditure
23. To give a thrust to investment in the economy, PSUs will also play their
part constructively. I am assured that the PSUs will invest through capital
investment a total sum of ` 2,47,941 crores in the current financial year to create
a virtuous investment cycle.
Smart Cities
24. As the fruits of development reach an increasingly large number of people,
the pace of migration from the rural areas to the cities is increasing. A neo middle
class is emerging which has the aspiration of better living standards. Unless,
new cities are developed to accommodate the burgeoning number of people, the
existing cities would soon become unlivable. The Prime Minister has a vision of
developing ‘one hundred Smart Cities’, as satellite towns of larger cities and by
modernizing the existing mid-sized cities. To provide the necessary focus to this
critical activity, I have provided a sum of `7,060 crore in the current fiscal.
e-Visa
25. Tourism is one of the larger job creators globally. Many economies world
over are supported by tourism. In order to give a major boost to tourism in India,
the facility of Electronic Travel Authorization (e-Visa) would be introduced in a
7
phased manner at nine airports in India where necessary infrastructure would be
put in place within the next six months. The countries to which the Electronic
Travel authorisation facility would be extended would be identified in a phased
manner. This would further facilitate the visa on arrival facility.
REITs & InvITs
26. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) have been successfully used as
instruments for pooling of investment in several countries. I intend to provide
necessary incentives for REITS which will have pass through for the purpose of
taxation. As an innovation, a modified REITS type structure for infrastructure
projects is also being announced as Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs),
which would have a similar tax efficient pass through status, for PPP and other
infrastructure projects. These structures would reduce the pressure on the banking
system while also making available fresh equity. I am confident these two
instruments would attract long term finance from foreign and domestic sources
including the NRIs.
Kissan Vikas Patra
27. Kissan Vikas Patra (KVP) was a very popular instrument among small
savers. I plan to reintroduce the instrument to encourage people, who may have
banked and unbanked savings to invest in this instrument.
Skill India
28. A national multi-skill programme called Skill India is proposed to be
launched. It would skill the youth with an emphasis on employability and
entrepreneur skills. It will also provide training and support for traditional
professions like welders, carpenters, cobblers, masons, blacksmiths, weavers
etc. Convergence of various schemes to attain this objective is also proposed.
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana
29. Bulk of our farm lands are rain fed and dependent on monsoons. Therefore,
there is a need to provide assured irrigation to mitigate risk. To improve access
to irrigation we propose to initiate the scheme “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee
Yojana”. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 1,000 crore for this purpose.
Swatchh Bharat Abhiyan
30. The need for sanitation is of utmost importance. Although the Central
Government is providing resources within its means, the task of total sanitation
cannot be achieved without the support of all. The Government intends to cover
every household by total sanitation by the year 2019, the 150th year of the Birth
anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi through Swatchh Bharat Abhiyan.
8
Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission
31. Gujarat has demonstrated successfully the Rurban development model
of urbanization of the rural areas, through which people living in the rural areas
can get efficient civic infrastructure and associate services. Shyama Prasad
Mukherji Rurban Mission will be launched to deliver integrated project based
infrastructure in the rural areas, which will also include development of economic
activities and skill development. The preferred mode of delivery would be through
PPPs while using various scheme funds for financing.
Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana
32. Power is a vital input for economic growth and the Government is
committed to providing 24x7 uninterrupted power supply to all homes. “Deen
Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana” for feeder separation will be launched to
augment power supply to the rural areas and for strengthening sub-transmission
and distribution systems. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 500 crore for this
purpose.
Statue of Unity
33. Government of Gujarat has embarked upon the mission to build the largest
statue of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. Sardar Patel stands as the symbol of the
unity of the country. To support the Gujarat Government in this initiative to erect
the Statue of Unity, I propose to set aside a sum of ` 200 crore.
II. PLAN & BUDEGTARY ALLOCATIONS
34. I now turn to budgetary allocations. While announcing the allocations,
I want to reiterate my Government’s firm commitment to strengthen the federal
structure of the country and our resolve to work closely with the state governments
for the larger good of the people.
Welfare of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes
35. Government is committed to the welfare of SCs and STs. This year an
amount of ` 50,548 crore is proposed under the SC Plan and `32,387 crore
under TSP.
36. To provide credit enhancement facility for young start up enterpreneurs
from Scheduled Castes, who aspire to be part of the neo-middle class, I propose
to set aside a sum of `200 crore which will be operationalised through a scheme
by IFCI.
37. For the welfare of the tribals “Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana” is being
launched with an initial allocation of `100 crore.
9
Welfare of Senior Citizens
Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana
38. NDA Government during its last term in office had introduced the
Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana (VPBY) as a pension scheme for senior citizens.
Under the scheme a total no. of 3.16 lakh annuitants are being benefitted and the
corpus amounts to ` 6,095 crore. I propose to revive the scheme for a limited
period from 15 August, 2014 to 14 August, 2015 for the benefit of citizens aged
60 years and above.
39. A large amount of money is estimated to be lying as unclaimed amounts
with PPF, Post Office, saving schemes etc. These are mostly out of investments
belonging to the senior citizens and on their demise, remain unclaimed for want
of relevant payment instructions. I propose to set up a committee to examine and
recommend how this amount can be used to protect and further financial interests
of the senior citizens. The committee will give its report not later than December
this year.
40. Government is fully committed to the social security and welfare of
employees serving in the organized sector. The Government is notifying minimum
pension of ` 1,000 per month to all subscriber members of EP Scheme and has
made an initial provision of ` 250 crore in the current financial year to meet the
expenditure. Further, increase in mandatory wage ceiling of subscription to EPS
from ` 6,500 to ` 15,000 has been made and a provision of ` 250 crore has been
provided in the current budget. For the convenience of the subscribers, EPFO
will launch the “Uniform Account Number” Service for contributing members
to facilitate portability of Provident Fund accounts.
Empowerment of the Differently Abled Persons
41. Government will make all out efforts to create a more inclusive society
for Persons with Disabilities to enable them to enjoy equal opportunities to lead
an empowered life with dignity. I propose to extend the scheme for Assistance to
Disabled Persons for purchase/fitting of Aids and Appliances (ADIP) to include
contemporary aids and assistive devices. It is also proposed to establish National
level institutes for Universal Inclusive Design and Mental Health Rehabilitation
and also a Centre for Disability Sports.
Incentives for the Visually Challenged
42. The Braille Presses in the Government and private sector are not able to
meet the demand of Braille Text books for the visually impaired students. It is
proposed to provide assistance to the State Governments to establish fifteen new
Braille Presses and modernize ten existing Braille Presses in the current financial
year. Government will also print currency notes with Braille like signs to assist
the visibly challenged persons.
10
Women & Child Development
43. Women’s safety is a concern shared by all the honourable members of
this House. We need to test out different approaches that can be validated and
scaled up quickly. An outlay of ` 50 crores will be spent by Ministry of Road
Transport & Highways on pilot testing a scheme on “Safety for Women on Public
Road Transport”. A sum of ` 150 crores will also be spent by Ministry of Home
Affairs on a scheme to increase the safety of women in large cities. It is also
proposed to set up “Crisis Management Centres” in all the districts of NCT of
Delhi this year in all government and private hospitals. The funding will be
provided from the Nirbhaya Fund.
Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana
44. It is a shame that while the country has emerged as a major player amongst
the emerging market economies, the apathy towards girl child is still quite rampant
in many parts of the country. Therefore I propose to launch Beti Bachao, Beti
Padhao Yojana which will be a focused scheme which would help in generating
awareness and also help in improving the efficiency of delivery of welfare services
meant for women. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for this.
Gender Mainstreaming
45. Government would focus on campaigns to sensitize people of this country
towards the concerns of the girl child and women. The process of sensitization
must begin early, therefore, the school curriculum must have a separate chapter
on gender mainstreaming.
Rural Development
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
46. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana initiated during the NDA-I under
the stewardship of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has had a massive impact
in improvement of access for Rural population. It is time to reaffirm our
commitment to a better and more energetic PMGSY under the dynamic leadership
of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. I propose to provide a sum of ` 14,389
crore.
MGNREGA
47. The Government is committed to providing wage and self-employment
opportunities in rural areas. However, wage employment would be provided
under MGNREGA through works that are more productive, asset creating and
substantially linked to agriculture and allied activities.
11
National Livelihood Mission
48. Ajeevika, the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), aims to
eliminate rural poverty through sustainable livelihood options. Under this mission,
Women SHGs are provided bank loans at 4% on prompt repayment in 150 districts
and at 7% in all other districts. I propose to extend the provision of bank loan for
women SHGs at 4% in another 100 districts. I also propose to set up a “Start Up
Village Entrepreneurship Programme” for encouraging rural youth to take up
local entrepreneurship programs. I am providing an initial sum of ` 100 crore
for this.
Rural Housing
49. The Rural Housing Scheme has benefited a large percentage of rural
population who have availed credit through Rural Housing Fund (RHF).
Accordingly, I propose to increase the allocations for the year 2014-15 to ` 8,000
crore for National Housing Bank (NHB) with a view to expand and continue to
support Rural Housing in the country.
Watershed Development
50. To give an added impetus to watershed development in the country,
I propose to start a new programme called “Neeranchal” with an initial outlay of
` 2,142 crores in the current financial year.
Panchayati Raj
51. Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF) is being implemented in 272
backward districts in 27 States, to fill up the critical gaps in development of
basic infrastructure facilities and for capacity building of Panchayats/ Gram
Sabhas in backward areas. It is proposed to restructure the BRGF to address
intra-district inequalities to ensure that backward sub-districts units within States
receive adequate support.
Safe Drinking Water
52. Many of our drinking water sources have excess impurities like flouride,
arsenic and manmade contaminations due to untreated sewage, industrial effluents
and leaching of pesticides and fertilizers. It is proposed to earmark ` 3,600 crore
under National Rural Drinking Water Programme for providing safe drinking
water in approximately 20,000 habitations affected with arsenic, fluoride, heavy/
toxic elements, pesticides/ fertilizers through community water purification plants
in next 3 years.
12
Health and Family Welfare
53. To move towards “Health for All”, the two key initiatives i.e. the Free
Drug Service and Free Diagnosis Service would be taken up on priority.
54. In order to achieve universal access to early quality diagnosis and
treatment to TB patients, two National Institutes of Ageing will be set up at
AIIMS, New Delhi and Madras Medical College, Chennai. A national level
research and referral Institute for higher dental studies would be set up in one of
the existing Dental institutions.
55. It is a matter of great satisfaction that all the six new AIIMS at Jodhpur,
Bhopal, Patna, Rishikesh, Bhubaneswar and Raipur, which are part of Pradhan
Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, have become functional. A plan to set up
four more AIIMS like institutions at Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Vidarbha in
Maharashtra and Poorvanchal in UP is under consideration. I propose to set
aside a sum of ` 500 crore for this. Presently 58 government medical colleges
have been approved. It is also proposed to add 12 more government medical
colleges. In addition, dental facilities would also be provided in all the hospitals.
56. For the first time, the Central Government will provide central assistance
to strengthen the States’ Drug Regulatory and Food Regulatory Systems by
creating new drug testing laboratories and strengthening the 31 existing State
laboratories.
57. In keeping with the Government’s focus on improving affordable
healthcare and to augment the transfer of technology for better health care facilities
in rural India, fifteen Model Rural Health Research shall be set up in the states,
which shall take up research on local health issues concerning rural population.
Education
School Education
58. Elementary education is one of the major priorities of the Government.
There is a residual gap in providing minimal school infrastructure facilities.
Government would strive to provide toilets and drinking water in all the girls
school in first phase. An amount of ` 28,635 crore is being funded for Sarva
Shiksha Abhiyan and `4,966 crore for Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.
A School Assessment Programme is being initiated at a cost of ` 30 crore. To
infuse new training tools and motivate teachers, “Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya
New Teachers Training Programme” is being launched. I am setting aside an
initial sum of ` 500 crore for this.
59. To take advantage of the reach of the IT, I propose to allocate a sum of
`100 crore for setting up virtual classrooms as Communication Linked Interface
for Cultivating Knowledge (CLICK) and online courses.
13
Higher Education
60. The country needs a large number of Centres of higher learning which
are world class. I propose to set up Jai Prakash Narayan National Centre for
Excellence in Humanities in Madhya Pradesh. I also intend to set up five more
IITs in the Jammu, Chattisgarh, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Five IIMs
would be set up in the States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha and
Maharashtra. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 500 crore for this.
61. Government also proposes to ease and simplify norms to facilitate
education loans for higher studies.
Digital India
62. There is an imminent need to further bridge the divide between digital
“haves” and “have-nots”. For this it is proposed to launch a pan India programme
“Digital India”. This would ensure Broad band connectivity at village level,
improved access to services through IT enabled platforms, greater transparency
in Government processes and increased indigenous production of IT hardware
and software for exports and improved domestic availability. Special focus would
be on supporting software product startups. A National Rural Internet and
Technology Mission for services in villages and schools, training in IT skills and
E-Kranti for government service delivery and governance scheme is also
proposed. I have provided a sum of ` 500 crore for this purpose.
63. A programme for promoting “Good Governance” would be launched
and I propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for this.
Information and Broadcasting
64. So far around 400 permissions for setting up of a Community Radio
Stations have been issued. To encourage the growth in this sector, a new plan
scheme is being taken up with an allocation of ` 100 crore. This scheme would
support about 600 new and existing Community Radio Stations.
65. Film & Television Institute, Pune and Satyajit Ray Film & Television
Institute, Kolkata are proposed to be accorded status of Institutes of national
importance and a “National Centre for Excellence in Animation, Gaming and
Special Effects will be set up.
Urban Development
Urban Renewal
66. It is time that our cities and towns undergo urban renewal and become
better places to live in. While developing housing and other infrastructure, both
physical and economic, which can have local variations, four fundamental
14
activities must underpin such development. These are provision of safe drinking
water and sewerage management, use of recycled water for growing organic
fruits and vegetable, solid waste management and digital connectivity. It is the
vision of this Government that at least five hundred (500) such habitations must
be provided support, while harnessing private capital and expertise through PPPs,
to renew their infrastructure and services in the next ten years.
Pooled Municipal Debt Obligation Facility
67. Pooled Municipal Debt Obligation Facility: This facility was set up in
2006 with participation of several Banks to promote and finance infrastructure
projects in Urban Area on shared risk basis. Present corpus of this facility is
`5,000 Crores. This Government has a major focus of providing good
infrastructure, including public transport, solid waste disposal, sewerage treatment
and drinking water in the urban areas. In keeping with the Hon’ble Prime
Minister’s vision for urban areas it is proposed to enlarge it to ` 50,000 Crores
with extension of the facility by five years to March 31, 2019.
Urban Transportation
68. Urban Metro Projects have proven to be very useful in decongesting
large cities. For two million plus cities, planning of metro projects must begin
now. Government will encourage development of metro rail systems, including
light rail systems, in the PPP mode, which will be supported by the Central
Government through VGF. In the current financial year, I propose to set aside a
sum of ` 100 crore for Metro Projects in Lucknow and Ahemdabad.
Housing for All
69. Our government is committed to endeavour to have housing for all by
2022. For this purpose, I intend to extend additional tax incentive on home loans
to encourage people, especially the young, to own houses.
70. I propose setting up a Mission on Low Cost Affordable Housing which
will be anchored in the National Housing Bank. Schemes will be evolved to
incentivize the development of low cost affordable housing. I propose to allocate
this year also a sum of ` 4,000 crores for NHB with a view to increase the flow
of cheaper credit for affordable housing to the urban poor/EWS/LIG segment.
I have already outlined some other incentives such as easier flow of FDI in this
sector. Government is willing to examine other suggestions that would spur
growth in this sector.
71. I also propose to add inclusion of slum development in the list of Corporate
Social Responsibility (CSR) activities to encourage the private sector to contribute
more towards this activity.
15
Malnutrition
72. A national programme in Mission Mode is urgently required to halt the
deteriorating malnutrition situation in India, as present interventions are not
adequate. A comprehensive strategy including detailed methodology, costing,
time lines and monitorable targets will be put in place within six months.
Minorities
73. A programme for the up gradation of skills and training in ancestral arts
for development for the minorities called “Up gradation of Traditional Skills in
Arts, Resources and Goods” would be launched to preserve the traditional arts
and crafts which are rich heritage.
74. An additional amount of ` 100 crores for Modernization of Madarsas
has been provided to the Department of School Education.
III. AGRICULTURE
75. Farming as an activity contributes nearly 1/6th to our National GDP and
a major portion of our population is dependent on it for livelihood. It has risen to
the challenge of making India largely self-sufficient in providing food for a
growing population. To make farming competitive and profitable, there is an
urgent need to step up investment, both public and private, in agro-technology
development and creation and modernization of existing agri-business
infrastructure. Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa has been at the
forefront of research in this area. However, since independence only one such
centre has been established. Government will establish two more such institutions
of excellence on similar pattern in Assam and Jharkhand with an initial sum of
`100 crore in the current financial year. In addition, an amount of ` 100 crores is
being set aside for setting up an “Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund”.
76. It is also proposed to establish Agriculture Universities in Andhra Pradesh
and Rajasthan and Horticulture Universities in Telangana and Haryana. An initial
sum of ` 200 crores has been allocated for this purpose.
77. Deteriorating soil health has been a cause of concern and leads to sub
optimal utilization of farming resources. Government will initiate a scheme to
provide to every farmer a soil health card in a Mission mode. I propose to set
aside a sum of ` 100 crore for this purpose and an additional ` 56 crores to set up
100 Mobile Soil Testing Laboratories across the country. There have also been
growing concerns about the imbalance in the utilization of different types of
fertilizers resulting in deterioration of the soil.
78. Climate change is a reality which all of us have to face together.
Agriculture as an activity is most prone to the vagaries of climate change. To
16
meet this challenge, I propose to establish a “National Adaptation Fund” for
climate change. As an initial sum an amount of ` 100 crore will be transferred to
the Fund.
79. We are committed to sustaining a growth of 4% in Agriculture and for
this we will bring technology driven second green revolution with focus on higher
productivity and include “Protein revolution” as an area of major focus.
80. As a very large number of landless farmers are unable to provide land
title as guarantee, institutional finance is denied to them and they become
vulnerable to money lenders’ usurious lending. I propose to provide finance to 5
lakh joint farming groups of “Bhoomi Heen Kisan” through NABARD in the
current financial year.
81. Price volatility in the agriculture produce creates uncertainties and
hardship for the farmers. To mitigate this I am providing a sum of ` 500 crore for
establishing a Price Stabilization Fund.
82. The farmers and consumers’ interest will be further served by increasing
competition and integrating markets across the country. To accelerate setting up
of a National Market, the Central Government will work closely with the State
Governments to re-orient their respective APMC Acts., to provide for
establishment of private market yards/ private markets. The state governments
will also be encouraged to develop Farmers’ Markets in town areas to enable the
farmers to sell their produce directly.
83. I also propose to set aside a sum of ` 50 crores for the development of
indigenous cattle breeds and an equal amount for starting a blue revolution in
inland fisheries.
Agriculture Credit
84. Banks are providing strong credit support to the agriculture sector. A
target of ` 8 lakh crore has been set for agriculture credit during 2014-15 which,
I am confident, the banks will surpass this.
Interest Subvention Scheme for Short Term Crop Loans
85. Under the Interest Subvention Scheme for short term crop loans, the
banks are extending loans to farmers at a concessional rate of 7%. The farmers
get a further incentive of 3% for timely repayment. I propose to continue the
Scheme in 2014-15.
Rural Infrastructure Development Fund
86. NABARD operates the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF),
out of the priority sector lending shortfall of the banks, which helps in creation
17
of infrastructure in agriculture and rural sectors across the country. I propose to
raise the corpus of RIDF by an additional ` 5,000 crores from the target given in
the Interim Budget to ` 25,000 crores in the current financial year.
Warehouse Infrastructure Fund
87. Increasing warehousing capacity for increasing the shelf life of agriculture
produces and thereby the earning capacity of the farmers is of utmost importance.
Keeping in view the urgent need for availability of scientific warehousing
infrastructure in the country, I propose an allocation of ` 5,000 crore for the fund
for the year 2014-15.
Creation of Long Term Rural Credit Fund
88. The share of long term investment credit in agriculture is going down as
compared to short term crop loan. This is severely hampering the asset creation
in agriculture and allied activities. In order to give a boost to long term investment
credit in agriculture, I propose to set up “Long Term Rural Credit Fund” in
NABARD for the purpose of providing refinance support to Cooperative Banks
and Regional Rural Banks with an initial corpus of ` 5,000 crore.
Allocation of STCRC (Refinance) Fund
89. The Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit (STCRC) – Refinance Fund
was announced in Union Budget 2008-09 with initial corpus of ` 5,000 crore. In
order to ensure increased and uninterrupted credit flow to farmers and to avoid
high cost market borrowings by NABARD, I propose to allocate an amount of
`50,000 crore for STCRC Fund during 2014-15.
Producers Development and Upliftment Corpus (PRODUCE)
90. The issue of profitability of small holding based agriculture has assumed
importance in view of increasing proportion of small and marginal farmers in
the country. I propose to supplement NABARD’s Producers’ organization
development fund for Producer’s development and upliftment called PRODUCE
with a sum of ` 200 crore which will be utilized for building 2,000 producers
organizations across the country over the next two years.
Food Security
91. Government is committed to reforms in the food sector. Restructuring
FCI, reducing transportation and distribution losses and efficacy of PDS would
be taken up on priority.
92. Government is also committed to provide wheat and rice at reasonable
prices to the weaker sections of the society. Even if due to inadequate rainfall
18
there is a marginal decline in agriculture production, stocks in the Central pool
are adequate to meet any exigency. Government shall, when required, undertake
open market sales to keep prices under control.
Kisan TV
93. Kisan TV, dedicated to the interests of the agriculture and allied sector
will be launched in the current financial year. This will disseminate real time
information to the farmers information regarding new farming techniques, water
conservation, organic farming etc. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for
this purpose.
IV. INDUSTRY
94. The eBiz platform aims to create a business and investor friendly
ecosystem in India by making all business and investment related clearances
and compliances available on a 24x7 single portal, with an integrated payment
gateway. All Central Government Departments and Ministries will integrate their
services with the eBiz platform on priority by 31 December this year.
95. A National Industrial Corridor Authority, with its headquarters in Pune,
is being set up to coordinate the development of the industrial corridors, with
smart cities linked to transport connectivity, which will be the cornerstone of the
strategy to drive India’s growth in manufacturing and urbanization. I have
provided an initial corpus of ` 100 crore for this purpose.
96. The Amritsar Kolkata Industrial master planning will be completed
expeditiously for the establishment of industrial smart cities in seven States of
India. The master planning of three new smart cities in the Chennai-Bengaluru
Industrial Corridor region, viz., Ponneri in Tamil Nadu, Krishnapatnam in Andhra
Pradesh and Tumkur in Karnataka will also be completed.
97. The perspective plan for the Bengaluru Mumbai Economic corridor
(BMEC) and Vizag-Chennai corridor would be completed with the provision
for 20 new industrial clusters.
98. Kakinada, its adjoining area and the port will be developed as the key
drivers of economic growth in the region with a special focus on hardware
manufacturing.
99. Exports cannot be exponentially increased unless the states play a very
active role in export promotion by providing good infrastructure and full
facilitation. It will be our endeavor to engage with the states to take India’s exports
to a higher growth trajectory. It is proposed to establish an Export promotion
Mission to bring all stakeholders under one umbrella.
19
Special Economic Zones
100. The Government is committed to revive the Special Economic Zones
(SEZs) and make them effective instruments of industrial production, economic
growth, export promotion and employment generation. For achieving this,
effective steps would be undertaken to operationalize the Special Economic
Zones, to revive the investors’ interest to develop better infrastructure and to
effectively and efficiently use the available unutilized land.
Apprenticeship
101. Comparing the size of the Indian economy, the performance of the
Apprenticeship Training Scheme is not satisfactory and a large number of training
facilities in the industry are unutilized. Apprenticeship Act will be suitably
amended to make it more responsive to industry and youth. We will also encourage
MSMEs to avail of the benefits of this scheme.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector
102. SMEs form the backbone of our Economy. They account for a large
portion of our industrial output and employment. The bulk of service sector
enterprises are also SMEs. Most of these SMEs are Own Account Enterprises.
Most importantly a majority of these enterprises are owned or run by SCs, STs
and OBCs. Financing to this sector is of critical importance, particularly as it
benefits the weakest sections. There is need to examine the financial architecture
for this sector. I propose to appoint a committee with representatives from the
Finance Ministry, Ministry of MSME, RBI to give concrete suggestions in three
months.
103. Promotion of entrepreneurship and start-up Companies remains a
challenge. While there have been some efforts to encourage, one principal
limitation has been availability of start-up capital by way of equity to be brought
in by the promoters. In order to create a conducive eco-system for the venture
capital in the MSME sector it is proposed to establish a `10,000 crore fund to
act as a catalyst to attract private Capital by way of providing equity, quasi equity,
soft loans and other risk capital for start-up companies.
104. To establish technology centre network to promote innovation,
entrepreneurship and agro-industry, I propose to set up a fund with a corpus of
`200 crore.
105. The definition of MSME will be reviewed to provide for a higher capital
ceiling. A programme to facilitate forward and backward linkages with multiple
value chain of manufacturing and service delivery will also be put in place.
20
106. Entrepreneur friendly legal bankruptcy framework will also be developed
for SMEs to enable easy exit. A nationwide “District level Incubation and
Accelerator Programme” would be taken up for incubation of new ideas and
providing necessary support for accelerating entrepreneurship.
Textiles
107. I propose to set up a Trade Facilitation Centre and a Crafts Museum with
an outlay of `50 crore to develop and promote handloom products and carry
forward the rich tradition of handlooms of Varanasi, where I also intend to support
a Textile mega-cluster. I also propose to set up six more Textile mega-clusters at
Bareily, Lucknow, Surat, Kuttch, Bhagalpur, Mysore and one in Tamil Nadu.
I am allocating a sum of ` 200 crore for this purpose.
108. I also propose to set up a Hastkala Academy for the preservation, revival,
and documentation of the handloom/handicraft sector in PPP mode in Delhi.
I have set aside a sum of ` 30 crore for this purpose.
109. I propose to start a Pashmina Promotion Programme (P-3) and a
programme for the development of other crafts of Jammu & Kashmir. I am setting
aside a sum of `50 crore for this purpose.
V. INFRASTRUCTURE
110. India has emerged as the largest PPP market in the world with over 900
projects in various stages of development. PPPs have delivered some of the
iconic infrastructure like airports, ports and highways which are seen as models
for development globally. But we have also seen the weaknesses of the PPP
framework, the rigidities in contractual arrangements, the need to develop more
nuanced and sophisticated models of contracting and develop quick dispute
redressal mechanism. An institution to provide support to mainstreaming PPPs
called 3P India will be set up with a corpus of `500 crores.
Shipping
111. A policy for encouraging the growth of Indian controlled tonnage will be
formulated to ensure increase in employment of the Indian seafarers. Development
of ports is also critical for boosting trade. Sixteen new port projects are proposed
to be awarded this year with a focus on port connectivity. ` 11,635 crore will be
allocated for the development of Outer Harbour Project in Tuticorin for phase I.
SEZs will also be developed in Kandla and JNPT. A comprehensive policy will
also be announced to promote Indian ship building industry in the current financial
year.
21
Inland Navigation
112. Development of inland waterways can improve vastly the capacity for
the transportation of goods. A project on the river Ganga called ‘Jal Marg Vikas’
(National Waterways-I) will be developed between Allahabad and Haldia to cover
a distance of 1620 kms, which will enable commercial navigation of at least
1500 tonne vessels. The project will be completed over a period of six years at
an estimated cost of ` 4,200 crore.
New Airports
113. Despite increase in air connectivity air travel is still out of reach of a
large number of aspirational Indians. Scheme for development of new airports
in Tier I and Tier II will be launched for implementation through Airport Authority
of India or PPPs.
Roads sector
114. Roads sector constitutes a very import artery of communication in the
country. The sector had taken shape from 1998-2004 under NDA-I. The sector
again needs huge amount of investment along with debottlenecking from maze
of clearances. I propose investment in National Highways Authority of India
and State Roads of an amount of `37,880 crores, which includes ` 3,000 crores
for the North East. During CFY a target of NH construction of 8500 km will be
achieved.
115. A modern nation needs multiple sources of transport. A country of the
size of India must have a transport network which can ensure faster travel across
cities which are geographically distant. This will also improve the supply chain
in transporting goods across cities. We will initiate work on select expressways
in parallel to the development of the Industrial Corridors. For project preparation
NHAI shall set aside a sum of ` 500 crore.
Power
116. To promote cleaner and more efficient thermal power, I propose to allocate
an initial sum of ` 100 crore for preparatory work for a new scheme “Ultra-
Modern Super Critical Coal Based Thermal Power Technology.”
Coal
117. Comprehensive measures for enhancing domestic coal production are
being put in place along with stringent mechanism for quality control and
environmental protection, which includes supply of crushed coal and setting up
of washeries. The existing impasse in the coal sector will be resolved and adequate
quantity of coal will be provided to power plants which are already commissioned
or would be commissioned by March 2015, to unlock dead investments. An
22
exercise to rationalize coal linkages which will optimize transport of coal and
reduce cost of power is underway.
New & Renewable Energy
118. New and Renewable energy deserves a very high priority. It is proposed
to take up Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu,
and Laddakh in J&K. I have set aside a sum of ` 500 crores for this. We are
launching a scheme for solar power driven agricultural pump sets and water
pumping stations for energizing one lakh pumps. I propose to allocate a sum of
` 400 crores for this purpose. An additional ` 100 crore is set aside for the
development of 1 MW Solar Parks on the banks of canals. Implementation of
the Green Energy Corridor Project will be accelerated in this financial year to
facilitate evacuation of renewable energy across the country.
Petroleum & Natural Gas
119. It is my Government’s intention to accelerate production and exploitation
of Coal Bed Methane reserves. The possibility of using modern technology to
revive old or closed wells will also be explored to maximize production from
such fields.
120. The usage of PNG will be rapidly scaled up in a Mission mode as it is
“clean” and efficient to deliver.
121. We have at present about 15,000 km of gas pipeline systems in the country.
In order to complete the gas grid across the country, an additional 15,000 km of
pipelines are required. It is proposed to develop these pipelines using appropriate
PPP models. This will help increase the usage of gas, domestic as well as imported,
which, in the long-term will be beneficial in reducing dependence on any one
energy sources.
Mining
122. It is my Government’s intention to encourage investment in mining sector
and promote sustainable mining practices to adequately meet the requirements
of industry without sacrificing environmental concerns. The current impasse in
mining sector, including, iron ore mining, will be resolved expeditiously. Changes,
if necessary, in the MMDR Act, 1957 would be introduced to facilitate this.
Revision of Royalty Rate
123. There have been requests from several State Governments to revise rate
of Royalty on minerals. Hon’ble Members are aware that rate of Royalty can be
revised after a period of three years. Last revision took place in August, 2009.
Therefore, another revision, which is due, will be undertaken to ensure greater
revenue to the State Governments.
23
VI. FINANCIAL SECTOR
Capital Market
124. Financial sector is at the heart of the growth engine. Globalization helps
channelize external savings to India to bridge the resource gap but also renders
the financial sector vulnerable to the vagaries of the global economy. We have
seen this in the recent past in ample measure. It is essential to strengthen and
modernize the legislative regulatory framework. There are some important
recommendations of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission like
the enactment of the Indian Financial Code which is considered necessary for
better governance and accountability. It will be my endeavor to complete the
ongoing process of consultations with all the stakeholders expeditiously on this.
It is also essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the
challenge of an increasingly complex economy. Government will, in close
consultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework.
125. While the impact of the above measures will be felt in the medium term,
towards the same objective, I propose to:
i. Advise financial sector regulators to take early steps for a vibrant,
deep and liquid corporate bond market and deepen the currency
derivatives market by eliminating unnecessary restrictions.
ii. Extend a liberalized facility of 5% withholding tax to all bonds issued
by Indian corporate abroad for all sectors and extend the validity of
the scheme to 30.06.2017.
iii. Liberalize the ADR/GDR regime to allow issuance of depository
receipts on all permissible securities.
iv. Allow international settlement of Indian debt securities.
v. Completely revamp the Indian Depository Receipt (IDR) and
introduce a much more liberal and ambitious Bharat Depository
Receipt (BhDR).
vi. Clarify the tax treatment on income of foreign fund whose fund
managers are located in India to resolve a long-standing problem.
Details will be presented in Part B.
126. The Indian capital markets have been a source of risk capital for a growing
India. I propose to take a number of measures to further energize these markets
including:
i. Introduction of uniform KYC norms and inter-usability of the KYC
records across the entire financial sector.
24
ii. Introduce one single operating demat account so that Indian financial
sector consumers can access and transact all financial assets through
this one account.
127. As part of strengthening the regulatory framework for commodity markets,
the Warehouse Development and Regulatory Authority (WD&RA) has begun a
transformation plan to invigorate the warehousing sector and significantly
improve post-harvest lending to farmers against negotiable warehouse receipts.
This plan will be implemented with vigor.
128. There is an urgent need to converge the current Indian accounting
standards with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). I propose
for adoption of the new Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) by the Indian
companies from the financial year 2015-16 voluntarily and from the financial
year 2016-17 on a mandatory basis. Based on the international consensus, the
regulators will separately notify the date of implementation of AS Ind for the
Banks, Insurance companies etc. Standards for the computation of tax would be
notified separately.
Banking
129. There have been some suggestions for consolidation of Public Sector
Banks. Government, in principle, agrees to consider these suggestions.
130. To provide all households in the country with banking services, a time
bound programme would be launched as Financial Inclusion Mission on 15
August this year. It would particularly focus to empower the weaker sections of
the society, including women, small and marginal farmers and labourers. Two
bank accounts in each household are proposed to be opened which will also be
eligible for credit.
131. Long term financing for infrastructure has been a major constraint in
encouraging larger private sector participation in this sector. On the asset side,
banks will be encouraged to extend long term loans to infrastructure sector with
flexible structuring to absorb potential adverse contingencies, sometimes known
as the 5/25 structure. On the liability side, banks will be permitted to raise long
term funds for lending to infrastructure sector with minimum regulatory pre-
emption such as CRR, SLR and Priority Sector Lending (PSL).
132. After making suitable changes to current framework, a structure will be
put in place for continuous authorization of universal banks in the private sector
in the current financial year. RBI will create a framework for licensing small
banks and other differentiated banks. Differentiated banks serving niche interests,
local area banks, payment banks etc. are contemplated to meet credit and
remittance needs of small businesses, unorganized sector, low income households,
farmers and migrant work force.
25
133. The rising Non Performing Assets of Public Sector Banks is a matter of
concern for the Government. Six new Debt Recovery Tribunals would be set up
at Chandigarh, Bengaluru, Ernakulum, Dehradun, Siliguri and Hyderabad.
Government will work out effective means for revival of other stressed assets.
Insurance Sector
134. Benefits of insurance in India have not reached a large section of the
people and insurance penetration and density are very low. The Government
would work towards addressing this situation in multi-pronged manner with the
support of all stake holders concerned. This would include suitable incentives,
using banking correspondents, strengthening micro-offices opened by public
sector insurance. It is also proposed to take up the pending insurance laws
(amendment) Bill for consideration of the Parliament.
135. As part of the legislative initiatives under financial sector reforms, it is
proposed to bridge the regulatory gap under the Prize Chits and Money Circulation
Scheme (Banning) Act, 1978. This step is expected to facilitate effective regulation
of companies and entities which have duped a large number of poor and vulnerable
people in this country.
Small Savings
136. To address the concerns of decline in savings rate and improving returns
for small savers, I propose to revitalize small savings.
137. My Government attaches utmost importance to the welfare of Girl Child.
A special small savings instrument to cater to the requirements of educating and
marriage of the Girl Child will be introduced. A National Savings Certificate
with insurance cover will also be launched to provide additional benefits for the
small saver.
138. In the PPF Scheme, annual ceiling will be enhanced to `1.5 lakh p.a.
from `1 lakh at present.
VII. DEFENCE & INTERNAL SECURITY
139. There can be no compromise with the defence of our country. I therefore
propose to allocate an amount of ` 2,29,000 crore for the current financial year
for Defence.
One Rank One Pension
140. We reaffirm our commitment to our brave soldiers. A policy of “One
Rank One Pension” has been adopted by the Government to address the pension
26
disparities. We propose to set aside a further sum of `1,000 crore to meet this
year’s requirement.
Modernization
141. Modernization of the armed forces is critical to enable them to play their
role effectively in the Defence of India’s strategic interests. I, therefore, propose
to increase the capital outlay for Defence by ` 5,000 crore over the amount
provided for in the interim Budget. This includes a sum of `1,000 crore for
accelerating the development of the Railway system in the border areas. Urgent
steps would also be taken to streamline the procurement process to make it speedy
and more efficient.
War Memorial
142. The country is deeply indebted to the officers and the jawans of the armed
forces for having made huge sacrifices to defend its honour. In doing so a very
large number of them gave up their lives. It is a privilege for the nation to erect
a befitting memorial in their memory. I am happy to announce that a War Memorial
will be constructed in the Princes Park. It will be supplemented by a War Museum.
I am allocating a sum of `100 crore for this purpose.
The Defence Production
143. In the year 2011 a separate fund was announced to provide necessary
resources to public and private sector companies, including SMEs, as well as
academic and scientific institutions to support research and development of
Defence systems that enhance cutting-edge technology capability in the country.
However, beyond the announcement, no action was taken. Therefore, I propose
to set aside an initial sum of `100 crore to set up a Technology Development
Fund to support this objective.
Internal Security
144. The scheme for modernization of state police forces would be reviewed.
I propose to enhance the allocation from a sum of `1,847 crore in the BE of
2013-14 to `3,000 crore in the current financial year. I am also allocating adequate
funds for carrying out small but much needed developmental activities as
Additional Central Assistance for Left Wing Extremist Affected districts.
145. In order to strengthen and modernize border infrastructure, a sum of
`2,250 crore has been set aside. In addition, a sum of `990 crore has been allocated
for the socio economic development of the villages along the borders. A sum of
`150 crore has also been ear-marked for the construction of Marine Police Station,
Jetties, for the purchase of boats etc.
27
National Police Memorial
146. The nation is equally indebted to the officers and the jawans of the Police
forces, including the central armed police forces, who are constantly engaging
with the enemy within and in the process sacrificing their lives in the line of
duty. I announce the construction of a befitting National Police Memorial. I
propose to set aside a sum of ` 50 crores for this purpose in the current financial
year.
VIII. CULTURE & TOURISM
147. India’s rich cultural, historical, religious and natural heritage provides a
huge potential for the development of tourism and job creation as an Industry.
I propose to create 5 tourist circuits around specific themes and set aside a sum
of ` 500 crore for this purpose.
148. National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation
Drive (PRASAD) shall be launched in this financial year. A sum of ` 100 crore
is being set aside for this purpose.
149. National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana
(HRIDAY) will also be launched for conserving and preserving the heritage
characters of these cities. To begin with I propose to launch this programme in
the cities such as Mathura, Amritsar, Gaya, Kanchipuram, Vellankani and Ajmer.
I propose to set aside a sum of ` 200 crore for this purpose. The Project will
work through a partnership of Government, academic institutions and local
community combining affordable technologies.
150. Archeological sites preservation requires urgent attention lest our ancient
heritage is lost to all future generations. For this purpose, I intend to set aside a
sum of `100 crore.
151. Sarnath-Gaya-Varanasi Buddhist circuit would also be developed with
world class tourist amenities to attract tourists from all over the world.
152. Goa has emerged as a major international convention centre. It has also
been declared as the permanent venue for International Film Festival of India.
There is an urgent need to develop world class convention facilities. This can
best be done in close collaboration with the private sector. Government of India
will fully support this initiative to develop the facilities in PPP mode through the
VGF scheme.
Water Resources and cleaning of Ganga
Linking of Rivers
153. Rivers form the lifeline of our country. They provide water not only for
producing food for the multitudes but also drinking water. Unfortunately the
28
country is not uniformly blessed with perennial rivers. Therefore, an effort to
link the rivers can give rich dividends to the country. It is time that we made a
serious effort to move in this direction. To expedite the preparation of the Detailed
Project Reports, I propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore.
Sacred Rivers
154. Substantial amount of money has been spent in the conservation and
improvement of the Ganga, which has a very special sacred place in the collective
consciousness of this country. However, the efforts have not yielded desired
results because of the lack of concerted effort by all the stakeholders. I propose
to set up Integrated Ganga Conservation Mission called “Namami Gange” and
set aside a sum of `2,037 crores for this purpose.
Development of Ghats and beautification of Riverfront
155. Our Riverfronts and Ghats are not only places of rich historical heritage
but many of these are also sacred. To start this process in the country, I propose
to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for Ghat development and beautification of
river front at Kedarnath, Haridwar, Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad, Patna and Delhi
in the current financial year.
NRI Ganga Fund
156. NRIs have been a very important contributor to the development process
in India, in areas such as education, health and preservation of culture. In this
context, to harness their enthusiasm to contribute towards the conservation of
the river Ganga, NRI Fund for Ganga will be set up which will finance special
projects.
Science and Technology
Technology Research Centres
157. The Department of Science & Technology has some of country’s leading
research centres in the areas such as nanotechnology, materials science and bio-
medical device technology. The government will strengthen at least five such
institutions as Technical Research Centres to make them more effective in the
innovation space through Public Private Partnerships.
Stimulating Investment In Biotechnology
158. The development of biotech clusters in Faridabad and Bengaluru will be
scaled up and taken to the highest international quality. This effort will include
global partnerships in accessing model- organism resources for disease biology,
stem cell biology and for high-end electron microscopy.
29
159. The nascent agri-biotech cluster in Mohali will be scaled up to include
plant-genetic and phenotype platforms. Secondary agriculture will be a major
thrust in Mohali through collaborations in the public and private sector. In
addition, two new clusters, in Pune and Kolkata will be established.
160. Global partnerships will be developed under India’s leadership to
transform the Delhi component of the International Centre for Genetic
Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) into a world-leader in life sciences
and biotechnology.
Indian Space Programme
161. Several major space missions are planned for 2014-15 which include the
experimental flight of India’s future heavy capacity launcher GSLV Mk-III, one
commercial launch of PSLV and two more navigational satellites.
162. Our Mars Orbiter spacecraft is in its 300 days long voyage to Planet
Mars along the designated helio-centric trajectory. Mars Orbiter Spacecraft is
expected to be orbiting around Mars on September 24, 2014.
Sports and Youth Affairs
Sports
163. Sports are an integral part of growing up and personality development.
Unfortunately, in our country, sports have not been main-streamed to date.
Government will set up national level Sports Academies for major games in
different parts of the country to mainstream sports.Academies with international
level facilities for training of accomplished athletes and for nurturing best talent
in the country at junior and sub-junior level will also be set up for Shooting,
Archery, Boxing, Wrestling, Weightlifting and various Track and field events.
164. Jammu & Kashmir has a lot of sporting talent which is not finding
expression due to inadequate sports facilities. I propose to provide a sum of
`200 crore for upgrading the indoor and outdoor sports stadiums to international
standards in Jammu and in Kashmir Valley.
165. I also propose to set up a sports university in Manipur. For this I am
providing a sum of ` 100 crore in the current financial year.
166. Unique sports traditions have developed in the Himalayan region in the
countries and the states that are a part of it. To promote these, India will start an
annual event to promote these games and would invite countries such as Nepal
and Bhutan also to participate in addition to the Indian states such as J&K,
Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and the North Eastern States.
30
167. I also propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for the training of our
sports women and men for the forthcoming Asian and Commonwealth games.
Youth
168. Employment exchanges will be transformed into career centres and in
addition for providing information about job availability. These centers will also
extend counseling facilities to the youth for selecting the jobs best suited to their
ability and aptitude. I have set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for this purpose.
169. Youth of India are pragmatic and forward looking and wish to be leaders
in all fields. In order to promote leadership skills, I propose to set up “A Young
Leaders Programme” with an initial allocation of ` 100 crore.
IX. OTHER PROPOSALS
Displaced Kashmiri Migrants
170. Displaced Kashmiri migrants require our special support for rehabilitation.
For this, I intend to provide a sum of ` 500 crore in the current financial year.
Conservation of Himalayas
171. There is a great need to increase the capacity in the country for Himalayan
Studies. I propose to set up a National Centre for Himalayan Studies in
Uttarakhand with an initial outlay of `100 crore.
Academy for Customs
172. It is proposed to set up the National Academy for Customs & Excise at
Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh.
North Eastern States
Organic Food
173. North Eastern Region of India has tremendous potential for development
of organic farming. With a growing global demand for organic food, people
living in the NE states can reap rich harvest from development of commercial
organic farming. To facilitate this, I propose to provide a sum of ` 100 crore for
this purpose in the current financial year.
North East Railway Connectivity
174. North Eastern Region has suffered from under development and a sense
of isolation due to lack of proper connectivity. Development of rail system is
31
urgently required to bridge this gap. I intend to expedite the development of rail
connectivity in the region and for this purpose I propose to set aside an additional
sum of ` 1,000 crore over and above the amount provided for in the interim
Budget.
24x7 Channel for the North East
175. TV is a very powerful tool for the expression of cultural identities and
for creating greater awareness of the richness of the diversity of our country. To
provide a strong platform to rich cultural and linguistic identity of the North-
East, a new 24x7 channel called “Arun Prabha” will be launched.
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
176. My Government is committed to addressing the issues relating to
development of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the AP Re-organization Act,
2014. Provision has been made by various Ministries/Departments to fulfill the
obligation of Union Government for both the States.
National Capital Territory of Delhi
177. NCT of Delhi faces large in-migration every year. Delhi is plagued by
frequent transmission related problems and issues of water distribution and supply.
In order to overcome this and make Delhi a world class city, I propose to provide
` 200 crore for power reforms and ` 500 crore for water reforms.
178. In addition, to solve the long term water supply issues to the capital region,
construction of long pending Renuka Dam would be taken up on priority. I have
provided an initial sum of ` 50 crore for this.
Andaman and Nicobar Island and Puducherry
179. Andaman and Nicobar Island are part of our rich cultural heritage. In
order to tide over communication related problems of the Island, I propose to
allot a sum of ` 150 crore.
180. Similarly, I propose to provide ` 188 crore to Puducherry for meeting
commitments for Disaster preparedness.
X. BUDGET ESTIMATES
181. I now turn to the Budget estimates for Main Budget 2014-15. We have
inherited a legacy, wherein, continuance of fiscal consolidation cannot be
compromised while providing for the essential items. However, we have mandate
to fulfill for the people. Keeping this in mind we have prepared the estimates of
expenditure and receipts for Financial Year 2014-15.
32
182. Non-Plan expenditure estimates for the Financial Year are `12,19,892
crore. While preparing Non-Plan estimates due care has been taken to fully provide
for all the essential activities. Additional amounts have been provided for fertilizer
subsidy and capital expenditure of Armed Forces.
183. While preparing estimates of plan expenditure, attention was paid to the
absorptive capacity of the Department and on achieving greater outcome with
the same financial outlay. In 2013-14, plan funds to the tune of `4,53,085 crore
could be utilised. Plan allocation of `5,75,000 crore in the Main Budget
2014-15 mark an increase of 26.9% over actuals for 2013-14 and have been
targeted towards Agriculture, capacity creation in Health and Education, Rural
Roads and National Highways Infrastructure, Railways network expansion, clean
energy initiatives, development of water resources and river conservation plans.
Further thorough convergence of programmes greater impact from the money
spent will be achieved.
184. Total expenditure estimates thus stands at ` 17,94,892 crore.
185. To finance this expenditure, it is estimated that Gross Tax receipts will
be ` 13,64,524 crore. After devolving the share of states, share of centre will be
` 9,77,258 crore. Non Tax Revenues for the current Financial Year will be
`2,12,505 crore and capital receipts other than borrowings will be `73,952 crore.
186. With the above estimates, fiscal deficit will be 4.1% of GDP and Revenue
deficit will be 2.9 per cent of GDP.
187. Hon’ble Members will recall that it was the initiative of the previous
NDA Government under Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which had made compulsory
10% allocation of plan funds for North Eastern Region and had made them Non-
lapsable in nature. From the current Budget, we have introduced a Statement
which will separately show plan allocation made for North Eastern Region. In
Financial Year 2014-15, an allocation of ` 53,706 crore has been made for North
Eastern Region. We have further made an allocation of `98,030 crore for women
and `81,075 crore for child welfare.

PART B
XI. TAX PROPOSALS
188. Madam Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals.
189. Taxes are important for every economy to fund Government expenditure
on security and welfare of its people. In the interim Budget 2014-15, my
predecessor had set revenue collection targets for direct taxes as well as indirect
taxes, which appear to be ambitious. I propose to retain these targets and it shall
be my endeavour to achieve the same. The impact of the tax changes now
proposed have of course been factored into the Budget Estimates, 2014-15.
190. While preparing the tax proposals, I had to encounter the challenge of an
extremely limited fiscal space. Nonetheless, I propose to introduce measures to
revive the economy, promote investment in manufacturing sector and rationalize
tax provisions so as to reduce litigation as well as to address the problem of
inverted duty structure in certain areas. I also propose to give relief to individual
taxpayers and to certain sectors of the economy.
Direct Taxes
191. Let me begin with direct taxes.
192. Madam Speaker, I do not propose to make any change in the tax rate.
However, with a view to provide relief to small and marginal taxpayers and
senior citizens, I propose to increase personal income tax exemption limit by
`50,000 that is, from `2 lakh to `2.5 lakh in the case of individual taxpayers
who are below the age of 60 years. Similarly, I also propose to raise the exemption
limit from `2.5 lakh to `3 lakh in the case of senior citizens.
193. I do not propose to make any change in the rate of surcharge either for
the corporates or the individuals, HUFs, firms etc.
194. The education cess for all taxpayers shall continue at 3 percent.
195. In the year 2012-13 the gross domestic savings were 30.1% of the GDP
as compared to 33.7% in the year 2009-10. Increase in savings and their
productive use leads to higher economic growth. The households are the main
contributors to savings. Therefore, to encourage domestic investment in long
34
term savings, I propose to increase the investment limit under section 80C of the
Income-tax Act from `1 lakh to `1.5 lakh.
196. Housing continues to be an area of concern for middle and lower middle
class due to high cost of financing. Therefore, to reduce this burden, I propose
to increase the deduction limit on account of interest on loan in respect of self
occupied house property from ` 1.5 lakh to ` 2 lakh.
197. Infrastructure and construction sectors have a significant role in the
economy. Growth in these sectors is necessary to revive the economy and generate
jobs for millions of our young boys and girls. As stated earlier and with a view to
attract large scale investment in these sectors, I have provided a conducive tax
regime for Infrastructure Investment Trusts and Real Estate Investment Trusts to
be set up in accordance with regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board
of India.
198. The manufacturing sector is of paramount importance for the growth of
our economy. This sector has multiplier effect on creation of jobs. Last year, an
incentive in the form of investment allowance to a manufacturing company that
invests more than ` 100 crore in plant and machinery during the period from
01.04.2013 to 31.03.2015 was announced. Considering the need to incentivize
smaller entrepreneurs, I propose to provide investment allowance at the rate of
15 percent to a manufacturing company that invests more than ` 25 crore in any
year in new plant and machinery. This benefit will be available for three years
i.e. for investments upto 31.03.2017. The Scheme announced last year will
continue to operate in parallel till 31.03.2015.
199. I also propose to extend the investment linked deduction to two new
sectors, namely, slurry pipelines for the transportation of iron ore, and semi-
conductor wafer fabrication manufacturing units. This will boost investment in
these two critical sectors.
200. Supply of power continues to be a major area of concern for the country.
Therefore, instead of annual extensions, I propose to extend the 10 year tax
holiday to the undertakings which begin generation, distribution and transmission
of power by 31.03.2017. This stability in our policy will help the investors to
plan their investments better.
201. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have invested more than ` 8 lakh crore
(about 130 billion US $) in India. One of their concerns is uncertainty in taxation
on account of characterization of their income. Moreover, the fund managers of
these foreign investors remain outside India under the apprehension that their
presence in India may have adverse tax consequences. With a view to put an end
35
to this uncertainty and to encourage these fund managers to shift to India,
I propose to provide that income arising to foreign portfolio investors from
transaction in securities will be treated as capital gains.
202. The concessional rate of tax at 15 percent on dividends received by Indian
companies from their foreign subsidiaries has resulted in enhanced repatriation
of funds from abroad. I propose to continue with this concessional rate of 15
percent on foreign dividends without any sunset date. This will ensure stability
of taxation policy.
203. In order to augment low cost long term foreign borrowings for Indian
companies, I propose to extend the eligible date of borrowing in foreign currency
from 30.06.2016 to 30.06.2017 for a concessional tax rate of 5 percent on interest
payments. I also propose to extend this tax incentive to all types of bonds instead
of only infrastructure bonds. I hope this measure will enable the companies to
step up their investments in India.
204. In order to reduce litigation on transfer pricing issues, I propose to make
certain changes in Transfer Pricing regulations.
(1) An Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) scheme was introduced in
the year 2012. It has received good response. I propose to strengthen
the administrative set up of APA to expedite disposal of applications.
Further, I propose to introduce a “Roll Back” provision in the APA
scheme so that an APA entered into for future transactions may also
be applied to international transactions undertaken in previous four
years in specified circumstances.
(2) In order to align Transfer Pricing regulations in India with the best
available practices, I propose to introduce range concept for
determination of arm’s length price. However, the arithmetic mean
concept will continue to apply where number of comparable is
inadequate. The relevant data is under analysis and appropriate rules
will be prescribed.
(3) As per existing provisions of Transfer Pricing Regulations, only one
year data is allowed to be used for comparable analysis with some
exception. I propose to amend the regulations to allow use of multiple
year data.
Necessary legislative amendments to give effect to the above proposals
including those relating to the Authority for Advance Rulings and Income-tax
Settlement Commission will be moved in the current session of the Parliament.
36
205. In the case of Mutual Funds, other than equity oriented funds, the capital
gains arising on transfer of units held for more than a year is taxed at a concessional
rate of 10% whereas direct investments in banks and other debt instruments
attract a higher rate of tax. This allows tax arbitrage opportunity. This arbitrage
has hardly benefitted retail investors as their percentage is very small among
such Mutual Fund investors. With a view to remove this tax arbitrage, I propose
to increase the rate of tax on long term capital gains from 10 percent to 20 percent
on transfer of units of such funds. I also propose to increase the period of holding
in respect of such units from 12 months to 36 months for this purpose.
206. In the year 2003, the tax liability on income by way of dividends was
shifted from the shareholder to the company. The shareholder was required to
pay tax on the gross dividends, but now the company pays tax on the dividend
amount net of taxes. Similarly, in the case of Mutual Fund, income distribution
tax is paid on the income distributed net of taxes. I propose to remove this
anomaly both in the case of the company and the Mutual Fund.
207. Currently, where an assessee fails to deduct and pay tax on specified
payments to residents, 100 percent of such payments are not allowed as deduction
while computing his income. This has caused undue hardship to taxpayers,
particularly where the rate of tax is only 1 to 10%. Hence, I propose to provide
that instead of 100 percent, only 30% of such payments will be disallowed.
208. The Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010 has lapsed with the dissolution of the
15th Lok Sabha. Having considered the report of the Standing Committee on
Finance and the views expressed by the stakeholders, my predecessor had placed
a revised Code in the public domain in March, 2014. The Government shall
consider the comments received from the stakeholders on the revised Code. The
Government will also review the DTC in its present shape and take a view in the
whole matter.
209. Income-tax Department is expected to function not only as an enforcement
agency but also as a facilitator. A number of Aykar Seva Kendras (ASK) have
been opened in different parts of the country. I propose to extend this facility by
opening 60 more such Seva Kendras during the current financial year to promote
excellence in service delivery.
210. The focus of any tax administration is to broaden the tax base. Our policy
thrust is to adopt non intrusive methods to achieve this objective. In this direction,
I propose to make greater use of information technology techniques.
211. Net Effect of the direct tax proposals is revenue loss of ` 22,200 crore.
37
Indirect Taxes
212. I now turn to indirect taxes and shall begin with customs duties.
213. Manufacturing sector is under stress due to a variety of reasons. To boost
domestic manufacture as also to address the issue of inverted duties, I propose to
reduce the basic customs duty (BCD) on:
•
Fatty acids, crude palm stearin, RBD and other palm stearin, specified
industrial grade crude oils from 7.5 percent to Nil for manufacture
of soaps and oleo-chemicals;
•
Crude glycerin from 12.5 percent to 7.5 percent and crude glycerin
used in the manufacture of soaps from 12.5 percent to Nil;
•
Steel grade limestone and steel grade dolomite from 5 percent to 2.5
percent;
•
Battery waste and battery scrap from 10 percent to 5 percent;
•
Coal tar pitch from 10 percent to 5 percent;
•
Specified inputs for manufacture of spandex yarn from 5 percent to
Nil.
214. In order to encourage new investment and capacity addition in the
chemicals and petrochemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty
on reformate from 10 percent to 2.5 percent; on ethane, propane, ethylene,
propylene, butadiene and ortho-xylene from 5 percent to 2.5 percent; on methyl
alcohol and denatured ethyl alcohol from 7.5 percent to 5 percent; and on crude
naphthalene from 10 percent to 5 percent.
215. The demand for electronics is growing very fast. To boost domestic
production and reduce our dependence on imports, I intend to take the following
steps:
•
Impose basic customs duty at 10 percent on specified
telecommunication products that are outside the purview of the
Information Technology Agreement;
•
Exempt all inputs/components used in the manufacture of personal
computers from 4 percent special additional duty (SAD);
•
Impose education cess on imported electronic products to provide
parity between domestically produced goods and imported goods;
•
Exempt 4 percent SAD on PVC sheet and ribbon used for the
manufacture of smart cards.
38
216. Cathode ray TVs are used by weaker sections who cannot afford to buy
more expensive flat panel TVs. I propose to exempt colour picture tubes from
basic customs duty to make cathode ray TVs cheaper. The duty concession will
help revive manufacturing of TVs in the SME sector and create employment
opportunities. At the same time, to encourage production of LCD and LED TVs
below 19 inches in India, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on LCD
and LED TV panels of below 19 inches from 10 percent to Nil. Further, to
encourage manufacture of LCD and LED TV panels, I propose to exempt from
basic customs duty specified inputs used in their manufacture.
217. The domestic stainless steel industry is presently suffering from severe
under-utilization of capacity. To give an impetus to the stainless steel industry,
I propose to increase the basic customs duty on imported flat-rolled products of
stainless steel from 5 percent to 7.5 percent.
218. We need to maximize our utilization of solar power. The existing duty
structure incentivizes imports rather than domestic manufacture of solar
photovoltaic cells and modules. Therefore, I propose to exempt from basic
customs duty:
•
specified inputs for use in the manufacture of EVA sheets and back
sheets;
•
flat copper wire for the manufacture of PV ribbons.
A concessional basic customs duty of 5 percent is also being extended to
machinery and equipment required for setting up of a project for solar energy
production.
219. To promote wind energy, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty
from 10 percent to 5 percent on forged steel rings used in the manufacture of
bearings of wind operated electricity generators. Also, I propose to exempt the
SAD of 4 percent on parts and raw materials required for the manufacture of
wind operated generators. Further, I propose to prescribe a concessional basic
customs duty of 5 percent on machinery and equipment required for setting up
of compressed biogas plants (Bio-CNG).
220. I have only highlighted some of the proposals in the Budget 2014-15.
I am sure these measures would incentivize value addition, generate income and
create more jobs in India.
221. I have also undertaken several tax rationalization measures. At present,
coal attracts customs duties at different rates. I propose to rationalize the duty
structure on all non-agglomerated coal at 2.5 percent basic customs duty and 2
percent CVD. Henceforth, anthracite coal, bituminous coal, coking coal, steam
39
coal and other coal will attract the same duty. This will eliminate all assessment
disputes and transaction costs associated with testing of various parameters of
coal.
222. Metallurgical coke is manufactured out of coking coal. The basic customs
duty on metallurgical coke is being increased from Nil to 2.5 percent in line with
the duty on coking coal.
223. Ships imported for breaking up attract basic customs duty at 5 percent.
As against this, melting scrap of iron or steel attracts basic customs duty at 2.5
percent. I propose to rationalize the duty on ship breaking scrap and melting
scrap of iron or steel by reducing the basic customs duty on ships imported for
breaking up from 5 percent to 2.5 percent.
224. Semi-processed, half cut or broken diamonds are presently exempt from
basic customs duty. As against this, cut and polished diamonds and coloured
gemstones attract basic customs duty of 2 percent. To prevent mis-use and avoid
assessment disputes, the basic customs duty on semi-processed, half cut or broken
diamonds, cut and polished diamonds and coloured gemstones is being
rationalized at 2.5 percent. To encourage exports, pre-forms of precious and
semi-precious stones are being fully exempted from basic customs duty.
225. To encourage exports of readymade garments I propose to increase the
duty free entitlement for import of trimmings, embellishments and other specified
items from 3 percent to 5 percent of the value of their exports.
226. Considering the need to conserve our natural resources, I propose to
increase the export duty on bauxite from 10 percent to 20 percent.
227. The free baggage allowance under the baggage rules was last revised in
2012. As a measure of passenger facilitation, I propose to increase the free baggage
allowance from ` 35,000 to ` 45,000.
228. I shall now deal with excise duties.
229. To provide a fillip to the capital goods, consumer durables and automobile
sectors, and given our commitment to revive economic growth, I have already
extended the excise duty concessions beyond 30th June 2014 for a period of 6
months up to 31st December 2014. We expect the industry to show positive
results in the coming months.
230. In continuation, I have a few more proposals to boost domestic production.
Minimization of harvest and post harvest losses of agricultural produce is an
important measure for tackling food inflation and ensuring food security. The
40
losses in fruits and vegetables are mainly due to lack of adequate processing
capacity. To incentivize expansion of processing capacity, I propose to reduce
the excise duty on specified food processing and packaging machinery from 10
percent to 6 percent.
231. As a measure of relief to the footwear industry, most of which are in
SME sector, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 12 percent to 6 percent on
footwear of retail price exceeding ` 500 per pair but not exceeding ` 1,000 per
pair. Footwear of retail price up to ` 500 per pair will continue to remain exempted.
232. I propose to withdraw the concessional excise duty (2 percent without
Cenvat benefit and 6 percent with Cenvat benefit) on smart cards and levy a
uniform excise duty at 12 percent. Consequently, imports will attract higher CVD.
This will help domestic industry.
233. To develop renewable sources of energy, I propose to exempt from excise
duty:
•
EVA sheets and solar back sheets and specified inputs used in their
manufacture;
•
solar tempered glass used in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic
cells and modules;
•
flat copper wire for the manufacture of PV ribbons for use in solar
cells and modules;
•
machinery and equipment required for setting up of a project for
solar energy production;
•
forged steel rings used in the manufacture of bearings of wind
operated generators;
•
machinery and equipment required for setting up of compressed
biogas plants (Bio-CNG).
234. To set at rest an on-going dispute, I propose to exempt PSF and PFY
manufactured from plastic waste and scrap including PET bottles from excise
duty with effect from 29th June, 2010 to 7th May, 2012. I also propose to levy
prospectively a nominal duty of 2 percent without Cenvat benefit and 6 percent
with Cenvat benefit on such PSF and PFY.
235. To encourage sports, I propose to prescribe a concessional excise duty of
2 percent without Cenvat benefit and 6 percent with Cenvat benefit on sports
gloves.
41
236. While undertaking all these measures, I also need to mobilize resources.
Accordingly, I propose to increase the specific excise duty on cigarettes in the
range of 11 percent to 72 percent. Similar increases are proposed on cigars,
cheroots and cigarillos. Likewise, the excise duty is being increased from 12
percent to 16 percent on pan masala, from 50 percent to 55 percent on
unmanufactured tobacco and from 60 percent to 70 percent on gutkha and chewing
tobacco. I also propose to levy an additional duty of excise at 5 percent on aerated
waters containing added sugar. These are healthy measures and I hope everyone
would welcome them from the point of view of human and fiscal health.
237. Clean Energy Cess is presently levied on coal, peat and lignite for the
purposes of financing and promoting clean energy initiatives and funding research
in the area of clean energy. I propose to expand the scope of purposes of levying
the said cess to include financing and promoting clean environment initiatives
and funding research in the area of clean environment. To finance these additional
initiatives, I propose to increase the Clean Energy Cess from ` 50 per tonne to
`100 per tonne.
238. I shall now deal with service tax.
239. In recent times, among indirect taxes, service tax has shown the highest
rate of growth. Since my overall objective is to prepare the indirect tax regime
for a smooth transition to Goods and Services Tax, changes have been kept
minimal at this stage. The twin objectives in this sector of indirect taxes are to
widen the tax base and enhance compliance. My proposals in relation to Service
Tax are in line with these objectives.
240. To broaden the tax base in Service Tax, it is necessary to prune the negative
list and exemptions to the extent possible. Accordingly, the negative list has
been reviewed and service tax leviable currently, on sale of space or time for
advertisements in broadcast media, is being extended to cover such sales on
other segments like online and mobile advertising. Sale of space for
advertisements in print media however would remain excluded from service
tax. Similarly, tax is being proposed on the service provided by radio-taxis to
place them on par with rent-a-cab service. These new levies will come into effect
from a date to be notified after the passing of the Finance Bill.
241. In furtherance of the effort to broaden the tax base, certain exemptions
are being withdrawn, including those extended to services by air-conditioned
contract carriages and technical testing of newly developed drugs on human
participants.
242. To spur growth in certain sectors, I have tried to correct the bottlenecks
which have been brought to my knowledge. Indian shipping industry had been
42
representing that they are losing business in a tough global scenario, due to a
provision in the Place of Provision of Services Rules, which is now being
addressed through an amendment. Similarly, to encourage growth in the transport
of goods through coastal vessels, the tax incidence is being reduced. In response
to the request of the tourism sector, services provided by Indian tour operators
to foreign tourists in relation to a tour wholly conducted outside India is being
taken out of the tax net. A long standing demand of this sector has been to allow
Cenvat credit for services of rent-a-cab and tour operators. I now propose to
allow credit in the same line of business.
243. I had to accept a few requests for exemptions from the social sector,
since exemption-induced distortion would be comparatively less in such sectors.
At the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, service tax on loading, unloading,
storage, warehousing and transportation of cotton, whether ginned or baled, is
being exempted to bring it on par with certain other agricultural produce. Services
provided by the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation for the period prior to
1st July 2012 is being exempted.
244. For the benefit of the common man, the exemption presently available
for specified micro insurance schemes is being expanded to cover all life micro-
insurance schemes where the sum assured does not exceed ` 50,000 per life
insured. Since taxes should not come in the way of safe disposal of medical and
clinical wastes, services provided by common bio-medical waste treatment
facilities are being exempted.
245. Certain changes are also proposed for bringing about greater clarity and
for reducing litigation regarding the scope of exemptions. These include functions
ordinarily entrusted to a municipality and services in relation to education.
246. There are a few more decisions which entail small gains or losses of
revenue. Certain amendments are also being proposed in the Customs and Central
Excise Acts and in the Finance Act, 1994 relating to service tax. These changes
are reflected in the budget documents.
247. My tax proposals on the indirect taxes side are estimated to yield ` 7,525
crore.
248. I have some more proposals which are in the nature of facilitating trade
and resolving disputes. I shall highlight only a few.
249. Faster clearance of import and export cargo reduces transaction costs
and improves business competitiveness. To help achieve these objectives,
measures are being initiated to extend the existing 24x7 customs clearance facility
43
to 13 more airports in respect of all export goods and to 14 more sea ports in
respect of specified import and export goods.
250. It is also proposed to implement an ‘Indian Customs Single Window
Project’ to facilitate trade. Under this, importers and exporters would lodge their
clearance documents at a single point only. Required permissions, if any, from
other regulatory agencies would be obtained online without the trader having to
approach these agencies. This would reduce interface with Governmental
agencies, dwell time and the cost of doing business.
251. The scheme of Advance Ruling in indirect taxes is being expanded to
cover resident private limited companies. This will allow these companies to
seek advance ruling in respect of new activities being proposed to be undertaken
by them. The scope of Settlement Commission is being enlarged to facilitate
quick dispute resolution.
252. To expedite the process of disposal of appeals, amendments have been
proposed in the Customs and Central Excise Acts with a view to freeing appellate
authorities from hearing stay applications and to take up regular appeals for final
disposal.
253. Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Budget to the House.

Budget 2012-2013
Speech of
Pranab Mukherjee
Minister of Finance
March 16, 2012
Madam Speaker,
I rise to present the Union Budget for 2012-13.
For the Indian economy, this was a year of recovery interrupted. When
one year ago, I rose to present the Budget, the challenges were many, but there
was a sense that the world economy was on the mend. The Budget was presented
in the first glimmer of hope. But reality turned out to be different. The sovereign
debt crisis in the Euro zone intensified, political turmoil in Middle East injected
widespread uncertainty, crude oil prices rose, an earthquake struck Japan and
the overall gloom refused to lift.
2. While I believe that there should be no room for complacency, nor any
excuse for what happens in one’s own country, we will be misled if we ignore
the ground realities of the world. The global crisis has affected us. India’s Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to grow by 6.9 per cent in 2011-12, after
having grown at the rate of 8.4 per cent in each of the two preceding years.
Though we have been able to limit the adverse impact of this slowdown on our
economy, this year’s performance has been disappointing. But it is also a fact
that in any cross-country comparison, India still remains among the front runners
in economic growth.
3. For the better part of the past two years, we had to battle near double-
digit headline inflation. Our monetary and fiscal policy response during this
period was geared towards taming domestic inflationary pressures. A tight
monetary policy impacted investment and consumption growth. The fiscal policy
had to absorb expanded outlays on subsidies and duty reductions to limit the
pass-through of higher fuel prices to consumers. As a result growth moderated
and the fiscal balance deteriorated.
4. But there is good news in the detail. With agriculture and services
continuing to perform well, India’s slowdown can be attributed almost entirely
to weak industrial growth. While we do not have aggregate figures for the last
http://indiabudget.nic.in
2
quarter of 2011-12, numerous indicators pertaining to this period suggest that
the economy is now turning around. There are signs of recovery in coal,
fertilisers, cement and electricity sectors. These are core sectors that have an
impact on the entire economy. Indian manufacturing appears to be on the cusp
of a revival.
5. We are now at a juncture when it is necessary to take hard decisions. We
have to improve our macroeconomic environment and strengthen domestic
growth drivers to sustain high growth in the medium term. We have to accelerate
the pace of reforms and improve supply side management of the economy.
6. We are about to enter the first year of the Twelfth Five Year Plan which
aims at “faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth.” The Plan will be launched
with the Budget proposals for 2012-13. In keeping with the stated priorities, I
have identified five objectives that we must address effectively in the ensuing
fiscal year. These are:
• Focus on domestic demand driven growth recovery;
• Create conditions for rapid revival of high growth in private
investment;
• Address supply bottlenecks in agriculture, energy and transport
sectors, particularly in coal, power, national highways, railways
and civil aviation;
• Intervene decisively to address the problem of malnutrition
especially in the 200 high-burden districts; and
• Expedite coordinated implementation of decisions being taken
to improve delivery systems, governance, and transparency; and
address the problem of black money and corruption in public
life.
7. Today, India has global responsibilities of a kind that it did not have
earlier. Our presence at the high table of global economic policy makers is a
matter of some satisfaction. It, however, places new responsibilities on our
shoulders. If India can continue to build on its economic strength, it can be a
source of stability for the world economy and provide a safe destination for
restless global capital.
8. I know that mere words are not enough. What we need is a credible
roadmap backed by a set of implementable proposals to meet those objectives.
In my attempt to do so, I have benefited from the able guidance of Hon’ble
Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and strong support of the UPA Chairperson
Smt. Sonia Gandhi.
http://indiabudget.nic.in

I would now begin with a brief overview of the economy.
Overview of the Economy
9. Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey
2011-12, which gives a detailed analysis of the economy over the past 12 months.
India’s GDP is estimated to grow at 6.9 per cent in real terms in 2011-12. The
growth is estimated to be 2.5 per cent in agriculture, 3.9 per cent in industry and
9.4 per cent in services. There is a significant slowdown in comparison to the
preceding two years, primarily due to deceleration in industrial growth, more
specifically in private investment. Rising cost of credit and weak domestic
business sentiment, added to this decline.
10. The headline inflation remained high for most part of the year. It was
only in December 2011 that it moderated to 8.3 per cent followed by 6.6 per cent
in January 2012. Monthly food inflation declined from 20.2 per cent in February
2010, to 9.4 per cent in March 2011 and turned negative in January 2012. Though
the February 2012 inflation figure has gone up marginally, I expect the headline
inflation to moderate further in the next few months and remain stable thereafter.
11. India’s inflation is largely structural, driven predominantly by agricultural
supply constraints and global cost push. Evidence suggests that prolonged periods
of high food inflation tend to get generalised. Fortunately, steps taken to bridge
gaps in distribution, storage and marketing systems to strengthen food supply
chains have helped us in a more effective management of inflation and led to a
decline in food inflation.
12. The developments in India’s external trade in the first half of the current
year were encouraging. During April-January 2011-12, exports grew by 23 per
cent to reach US Dollar 243 billion, while imports at US Dollar 391 billion
recorded a growth of over 29 per cent. What is heartening is that India has
successfully achieved diversification of export and import markets. The share of
Asia, including ASEAN, in total trade increased from 33.3 per cent in
2000-2001 to 57.3 per cent in the first half of 2011-12. This has helped us weather
the impact of global crisis emanating from Europe and to a lesser extent from
USA.
13. The current account deficit as a proportion of GDP for 2011-12 is likely
to be around 3.6 per cent. This, along with reduced net capital inflows in the
second and third quarters, put pressure on the exchange rate.
14. Taking a bird’s eye view of the entire economy and keeping in mind the
difficult global environment, I expect India’s GDP growth in 2012-13 to be 7.6
per cent, +/- 0.25 per cent.
15. I expect average inflation to be lower next year. I also expect the current
account deficit to be smaller, aided by improvement in domestic financial savings.
http://indiabudget.nic.in

II. Growth
I now turn to growth and fiscal consolidation.
16. Our fiscal balance has deteriorated in 2011-12 due to slippage in direct
tax revenue and increased subsidies. On both counts our underlying assumptions
at the time of Budget presentation last year were belied by subsequent
developments. The profit margins came under pressure due to higher interest
rates and material costs. This impacted growth in corporate taxes. Further, as
against an assumption of US Dollar 90 a barrel, the average price of crude oil in
2011-12 is likely to exceed US Dollar 115. This has necessitated higher outlay
on subsidies than projected. The continuing uncertainty in the global environment
makes it necessary for us to strike a balance between fiscal consolidation and
strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals to create adequate headroom to deal
with future shocks.
Fiscal Consolidation
FRBM Act
17. The implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management
Act, 2003 (FRBM Act) at Centre and the corresponding Acts at State level was
the pivot in the successful consolidation of our fiscal balance prior to the global
financial crisis of 2008. The outbreak of the crisis coincided with the year when
the mandated targets of 3 per cent fiscal deficit and elimination of revenue deficit
were to be achieved. The Government had to deviate from these targets due to
injection of fiscal stimulus at that time. Following my announcement in the last
Budget Speech, I am now introducing amendments to the FRBM Act as part of
Finance Bill, 2012.
Expenditure Reforms
18. The fiscal targets for Centre under the amendments to the FRBM Act are
indicated in the Budget documents. Meanwhile, I would like to highlight two of
its features that are steps in the direction of expenditure reforms. First, the concept
of Effective Revenue Deficit, introduced in the last Budget, to address the
structural imbalances in the revenue account, is being brought in as a fiscal
parameter. Effective Revenue Deficit is the difference between revenue deficit
and grants for creation of capital assets. Focusing on this will help in reducing
the consumptive component of revenue deficit and create space for increased
capital spending.
19. Second, a provision for “Medium-term Expenditure Framework
Statement” is being introduced in the Act. This statement shall set forth a three-
year rolling target for expenditure indicators. It would help in undertaking a de-
novo exercise for allocating resources for prioritised schemes and weeding out
others that have outlived their utility. This would provide greater certainty in
multi-year budgeting framework. It would also encourage efficiencies in
expenditure management.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
5
20. In implementing the Twelfth Plan, the recommendations made by the
Expert Committees to streamline and reduce the number of Centrally Sponsored
Schemes and to address Plan and non-Plan classification, would be kept in
view. The Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System would be expanded to
facilitate better tracking and utilisation of funds released by the Central
Government.
Subsidies
21. Fiscal consolidation calls for efforts both to raise the tax-GDP ratio and
to lower the expenditure. In this context, we need to take a close look at the
growth of our revenue expenditure, particularly on subsidies. The major subsidies
at the Centre are for food, fertilisers and petroleum products. Some subsidies at
this juncture in our development are inevitable. But they become undesirable if
they compromise the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy, more so,
when they don’t reach the intended beneficiaries.
22. The Government has decided that from 2012-13 subsidies related to food
and for administering the Food Security Act will be fully provided for. All other
subsidies would be funded to the extent that they can be borne by the economy
without any adverse implications. It would be my endeavour to restrict the
expenditure on Central subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. Over
the next three years, it would be further brought down to 1.75 per cent of GDP.
Such a step is needed to improve the quality of public spending. Our effort now
will be directed towards better targeting and leakage proof delivery of the
subsidies.
23. The recommendations of the task force headed by Shri Nandan Nilekani
on IT strategy for direct transfer of subsidy have been accepted. Based on these
recommendations, a mobile- based Fertiliser Management System (mFMS) has
been designed to provide end-to-end information on the movement of fertilisers
and subsidies, from the manufacturer to the retail level. This will be rolled out
nation-wide during 2012. Direct transfer of subsidy to the retailer, and eventually
to the farmer will be implemented in subsequent phases. This step will benefit
12 crore farmer families, while reducing expenditure on subsidies by curtailing
misuse of fertilisers.
24. All the three public sector Oil Marketing Companies have launched LPG
transparency portals to improve customer service and reduce leakage. A pilot
project for selling LPG at market price and reimbursement of subsidy directly
into the beneficiary’s bank account is being conducted in Mysore. A similar pilot
project on direct transfer of subsidy for kerosene into the bank accounts of
beneficiaries has been initiated in Alwar district of Rajasthan. The Aadhaar
platform has also been successfully used to validate PDS ration cards in
Jharkhand.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
6
25. These pilot projects show that substantial economies in subsidy outgo
can be achieved by the use of Aadhaar platform. It will be our endeavour to scale
up and roll out these Aadhaar enabled payments for various government schemes
in at least 50 selected districts within the next six months.
Tax Reforms
26. As Hon’ble Members are aware, the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) Bill was
introduced in Parliament in August 2010. It was our earnest desire to give effect
to DTC from April 1, 2012. However, we received the Report of the Parliamentary
Standing Committee on March 9, 2012. We will examine the report expeditiously
and take steps for the enactment of DTC at the earliest.
27. Similarly, the Constitution Amendment Bill, a preparatory step in the
implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced in Parliament
in March 2011 and is before the Parliamentary Standing Committee. As we await
recommendations of the Committee, drafting of model legislation for Centre
and State GST in concert with States is under progress.
28. The structure of GST Network (GSTN) has been approved by the
Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers. GSTN will be set up as a
National Information Utility and will become operational by August 2012. The
GSTN will implement common PAN-based registration, returns filing and
payments processing for all States on a shared platform. The use of PAN as a
common identifier in both direct and indirect taxes, will enhance transparency
and check tax evasion. I solicit the support of all my colleagues cutting across
party lines for an early passage of these landmark legislations.
Disinvestment Policy
29. The Government has further evolved its approach to divestment of Central
Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The CPSEs are being given a level playing
field vis-a-vis the private sector with regard to practices like buy-backs and listing
at stock exchange. The treasury management options for CPSEs have also been
enhanced. This will help improve the returns on public assets, support transparent
environment for the divestment process, besides unlocking the value and resources
for all stakeholders.
30. In 2011-12, as against a target of ` 40,000 crore, the Government will
raise about ` 14,000 crore from disinvestment. For 2012-13, I propose to raise
` 30,000 crore through disinvestment. Let me reiterate here that while we are
committed to enhancing people’s ownership of CPSEs, at least 51 per cent
ownership and management control will remain with the Government.
http://indiabudget.nic.in

Strengthening Investment Environment
31. The domestic investment environment has suffered on multiple counts
in the past year. It is time to fast track policy decisions and ensure on-time
implementation of major projects.
Foreign Direct Investment
32. Organised retail helps in reducing cost of intermediation due to economies
of scale, benefiting both consumers and producers. At present, FDI in single
brand and in cash and carry wholesale trade is permitted to the extent of 100 per
cent. The decision in respect of allowing FDI in multi-brand retail trade up to 51
per cent, subject to compliance with specified conditions, has been held in
abeyance. Efforts are on to arrive at a broad based consensus in consultation
with the State Governments.
Advance Pricing Agreement
33. In a globalised economy with expanding cross-border production chains
and growing trade within entities of the same group, Advance Pricing Agreement
(APA) can significantly bring down tax litigation and provide tax certainty to
foreign investors. Though, the provision for APA has been included in the DTC
Bill, 2010, I propose to bring forward its implementation by introducing it in the
Finance Bill, 2012.
Financial Sector
34. Reforms in the financial sector have been pursued with the objective of
more efficient market intermediation between savers and investors.
35. To encourage flow of savings in financial instruments and improve the
depth of domestic capital market, it is proposed to introduce a new scheme called
Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme. The scheme would allow for income tax
deduction of 50 per cent to new retail investors, who invest up to ` 50,000 directly
in equities and whose annual income is below ` 10 lakh. The scheme will have
a lock-in period of 3 years. The details will be announced in due course.
Capital Markets
36. During the year 2011-12, we took a series of steps to deepen the capital
market and encourage investment in infrastructure sector. These steps included
raising of FII investment limit in long-term infrastructure bonds, corporate bonds
and government securities. The limit on External Commercial Borrowings (ECB)
was also raised and qualified foreign investors were allowed to invest in specified
Indian mutual funds and directly in equities.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
8
37. I now propose to take the next steps in deepening the reforms in Capital
market by:
• Allowing Qualified Foreign Investors (QFIs) to access Indian
Corporate Bond market;
• Simplifying the process of issuing Initial Public Offers (IPOs),
lowering their costs and helping companies reach more retail
investors in small towns. To achieve this, in addition to the existing
IPO process, I propose to make it mandatory for companies to issue
IPOs of ` 10 crore and above in electronic form through nationwide
broker network of stock exchanges;
• Providing opportunities for wider shareholder participation in
important decisions of the companies through electronic voting
facilities, besides existing process for shareholder voting, which
would be made mandatory initially for top listed companies;
and
• Permitting two-way fungibility in Indian Depository Receipts
subject to a ceiling with the objective of encouraging greater foreign
participation in Indian capital market.
Legislative Reforms
38. We have received the recommendations of the Standing Committee on
Finance on “The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill,
2011”, “The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2011” and “The Insurance Laws
(Amendment) Bill, 2008”. The official amendments to these Bills will be moved
in this session of the Parliament.
39. To take forward the process of financial sector legislative reforms, the
Government proposes to move the following Bills in the Budget Session of the
Parliament:
• The Micro Finance Institutions (Development and Regulation) Bill,
2012;
• The National Housing Bank (Amendment) Bill, 2012;
• The Small Industries Development Bank of India (Amendment)
Bill, 2012;
• National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development
(Amendment) Bill, 2012;
• Regional Rural Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2012;
• Indian Stamp (Amendment) Bill, 2012; and
• Public Debt Management Agency of India Bill, 2012.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
9
40. The Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws
(Amendment) Bill, 2011 has already been introduced in Parliament.
Capitalisation of Banks and Financial Holding Company
41. The Government is committed to protect the financial health of Public
Sector Banks and financial institutions. For the year 2012-13, I propose to provide
` 15,888 crore for capitalisation of Public Sector Banks, Regional Rural Banks
and other financial institutions including NABARD. The Government is also
examining the possibility of creating a financial holding company which will
raise resources to meet the capital requirements of Public Sector Banks.
42. To bring banking payment structure at par with global standards, a
comprehensive action plan has been prepared for implementation in 2012-13. A
central Know Your Customer (KYC) depository will be developed in 2012-13 to
avoid multiplicity of registration and data upkeep.
Priority Sector Lending
43. A committee set up by RBI to re-examine the existing classification and
suggest revised guidelines on priority sector lending has submitted its report.
After stakeholder consultation, revised guidelines will be issued.
Financial Inclusion
44. In 2010-11, “Swabhimaan” campaign was launched to extend banking
facilities through Business Correspondents to habitations having population in
excess of 2000. I am happy to announce that out of 73,000 identified habitations
that were to be covered by March, 2012, about 70,000 habitations have been
provided with banking facilities. With this, over 2.55 crore beneficiary accounts
would have been operationalised. The remaining habitations are likely to be covered
by March 31, 2012. As a next step, Ultra Small Branches are being set up at these
habitations, where the Business Correspondents would deal with cash transactions.
45. In 2012-13, I propose to extend the “Swabhimaan” campaign to habitations
with population of more than 1000 in North Eastern and hilly States and to other
habitations which have crossed population of 2,000 as per Census 2011.
Regional Rural Banks
46. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) have played a crucial role in meeting the
credit needs of rural areas. I am happy to inform that of the 82 RRBs in India, 81
have successfully migrated to Core Banking Solutions (CBS) and have also joined
the National Electronic Fund Transfer system.
47. The Government had initiated the process of capitalisation of 40
financially weak RRBs, which has been completed in respect of 12 RRBs by the
end of February, 2012. I propose to extend the scheme of capitalisation of weak
RRBs by another 2 years to enable all the States to contribute their share.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
10
III. Infrastructure and Industrial Development
Let me now turn to infrastructure and industrial development.
48. Lack of adequate infrastructure is a major constraint on our growth. The
strategy we have followed so far is to increase investment in infrastructure through
a combination of public investment and public private partnerships (PPP). During
the Twelfth Plan period, infrastructure investment will go up to ` 50 lakh crore.
About half of this is expected to come from private sector.
49. Viability Gap Funding (VGF) under the Scheme for Support to PPP in
infrastructure is an important instrument in attracting private investment into
the sector. This year it has been decided to make irrigation (including dams,
channels and embankments), terminal markets, common infrastructure in
agriculture markets, soil testing laboratories and capital investment in fertiliser
sector eligible for VGF under this scheme. Oil and Gas/LNG storage facilities
and oil and gas pipelines, fixed network for telecommunication and
telecommunication towers will also be made eligible sectors for VGF.
50. The Government has approved guidelines for establishing joint venture
companies by defence Public Sector Undertakings in PPP mode. This will serve
the dual purpose of achieving substantive self-reliance in the defence sector and
production of state-of-the-art defence goods.
51. I had announced the setting up of Infrastructure Debt Funds to tap the
overseas markets for long tenor pension and insurance funds. I am happy to
inform the House that the first Infrastructure Debt Fund with an initial size of
`8000 crore, has been launched earlier this month.
52. For the year 2011-12, tax-free bonds for ` 30,000 crore were announced
for financing infrastructure projects. I propose to double it to raise `60,000 crore
in 2012-13. This includes `10,000 crore for NHAI, `10,000 crore for IRFC,
`10,000 crore for IIFCL, `5,000 crore for HUDCO, `5,000 crore for National
Housing Bank, `5,000 crore for SIDBI, `5,000 crore for ports and `10,000 crore
for power sector.
53. A harmonised master list of infrastructure sector has been approved by
the Government. This will help in removing ambiguity in the policy and regulatory
domain and encourage investment in the infrastructure sector.
54. To ease access of credit to infrastructure projects, India Infrastructure
Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) has put in place a structure for credit
enhancement and take-out finance. A consortium for direct lending and grant of
in-principle approval to developers before the submission of bids for PPP projects
has also been created.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
11
National Manufacturing Policy
55. The Government has announced a National Manufacturing Policy on
October 25, 2011 with the objective of raising, within a decade, the share of
manufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent and creation of 10 crore jobs. The Policy
encourages the setting-up of National Investment and Manufacturing Zones
(NIMZs) across the country.
56. I will now address some issues that have impacted infrastructure and
industrial activity in the past months.
Power and Coal
57. In power generation, fuel supply constraints are affecting production
prospects. To address this concern, Coal India Limited (CIL) has been advised
to sign fuel supply agreements, with power plants that have entered into long-
term Power Purchase Agreements with DISCOMs and would get commissioned
on or before March 31, 2015. An inter-ministerial group is being constituted to
undertake periodic review of the allocated coal mines and make recommendations
on de-allocations, if so required.
58. I propose to allow External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to part finance
Rupee debt of existing power projects.
Transport: Roads and Civil Aviation
59. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is set to achieve its
target of awarding projects covering a length of 7,300 km under NHDP during
2011-12. This would be 44 per cent higher than the best ever length of 5,082 km
awarded in 2010-11. Of the 44 projects awarded during 2011-12, 24 projects
have fetched a premium. I propose to set a target of covering a length of 8,800
kms under NHDP next year. The allocation of the Ministry has been enhanced
by 14 per cent to ` 25,360 crore in 2012-13.
60. To encourage public private partnerships in road construction projects, I
propose to allow ECB for capital expenditure on the maintenance and operations
of toll systems for roads and highways so long as they are a part of the original
project.
61. The airline industry is facing financial crisis. The high operating cost of
the sector is largely attributable to the cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF). To
reduce the cost of ATF, Government has permitted direct import of ATF by Indian
Carriers, as actual users.
62. To address the immediate financing concerns of the Civil Aviation sector,
I propose to permit ECB for working capital requirements of the airline industry
for a period of one year, subject to a total ceiling of US Dollar 1 billion.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
12
63. A proposal to allow foreign airlines to participate up to 49 per cent in the
equity of an air transport undertaking engaged in operation of scheduled and
non-scheduled air transport services is under active consideration of the
Government.
Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor
64. The Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) is being developed on
either side along the alignment of the Western Dedicated Rail Freight Corridor.
The project has made significant progress. In September 2011, Central assistance
of `18,500 crore spread over a period of 5 years has been approved. The Japanese
Prime Minister has announced US$ 4.5 billion as Japanese participation in DMIC
project.
Housing sector
65. In view of the shortage of housing for low income groups in major cities
and towns, I propose to:
• Allow ECB for low cost affordable housing projects;
• Set up Credit Guarantee Trust Fund to ensure better flow of
institutional credit for housing loans;
• Enhance provisions under Rural Housing Fund from ` 3000 crore
to ` 4000 crore;
• Extend the scheme of interest subvention of 1 per cent on housing
loan up to `15 lakh where the cost of the house does not exceed
`25 lakh for another year; and
• Enhance the limit of indirect finance under priority sector from
` 5 lakh to ` 10 lakh.
Fertilisers
66. To reduce India’s import dependence in urea, Government has taken steps
to finalise pricing and investment policies for urea. It is expected that with the
implementation of the investment policy, country will become self sufficient in
manufacturing urea in the next five years. In case of the potassic-phosphatic
(P&K) fertiliser, use of single super phosphate (SSP) will be encouraged through
greater extension work. This fertiliser is manufactured entirely in the domestic
sector. Enhanced production would bring down our dependence on imports in
the P&K sector.
Textiles
67. The Government has recently announced a financial package of ` 3,884
crore for waiver of loans of handloom weavers and their cooperative societies.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
13
68. In addition to 4 mega handloom clusters already operationalised, I am
now happy to announce two more mega clusters, one to cover Prakasam and
Guntur districts in Andhra Pradesh and the other for Godda and neighbouring
districts in Jharkhand. I also propose to provide assistance in setting up of
dormitories for women workers in the 5 mega clusters relating to handloom,
power loom and leather sectors.
69. The Ministry of Textiles runs Weavers’ Service Centres in different
parts of the country for providing technical support to poor handloom weavers.
I propose to set up three such Centres, one each in Mizoram, Nagaland and
Jharkhand. I am also happy to announce ` 500 crore pilot scheme in the
Twelfth Plan for promotion and application of Geo-textiles in the North East
Region.
70. To address the need of the local artisans and weavers, I propose to set up
a powerloom mega cluster in Ichalkaranji in Maharashtra with a Budget allocation
of ` 70 crore.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
71. In order to enhance availability of equity to MSME sector, I propose to
set up a ` 5,000 crore India Opportunities Venture Fund with SIDBI.
72. The Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the building blocks of
our economy. They rely primarily on loans from banks and informal sources to
raise capital. To enable these enterprises greater access to finance, two SME
exchanges have been launched in Mumbai recently.
Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises
73. With the objective of promoting market access of Micro and Small
Enterprises, Government has approved a policy which requires Ministries and
CPSEs to make a minimum of 20 per cent of their annual purchases from MSEs.
Of this, 4 per cent will be earmarked for procurement from MSEs owned by SC/
ST entrepreneurs.
IV. Agriculture
I now take up agriculture.
74. Agriculture will continue to be a priority for the Government. The total
plan outlay for the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation is being increased
by 18 per cent from ` 17,123 crore in 2011-12 to ` 20,208 crore in 2012-13.
75. The outlay for Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) is being increased
from `7,860 crore in 2011-12 to ` 9,217 crore in 2012-13. I am happy to inform
the House that the initiative of Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India
(BGREI) has resulted in a significant increase in production and productivity of
paddy. States in eastern India have reported additional paddy production of seven
million tonnes in Kharif 2011. I propose to increase the allocation for this scheme
from `400 crore in 2011-12 to `1000 crore in 2012-13.

76. This year, under RKVY, I also propose to allocate `300 crore to Vidarbha
Intensified Irrigation Development Programme. This Scheme seeks to bring in
more farming areas under protective irrigation.
77. The Government intends to merge the remaining activities into a set of
missions to address the needs of agricultural development in the Twelfth Five
Year Plan. These Missions are:
(i) National Food Security Mission which aims to bridge the yield
gap in respect of paddy, wheat, pulses, millet and fodder. The
ongoing Integrated Development of Pulses Villages, Promotion of
Nutri-cereals and Accelerated Fodder Development Programme
would now become a part of this Mission;
(ii) National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture including Micro
Irrigation is being taken up as a part of the National Action Plan
on Climate Change. The Rainfed Area Development Programme
will be merged with this;
(iii) National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm aims to increase
production and productivity of oil seeds and oil palm;
(iv) National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology
focuses on adoption of appropriate technologies by farmers for
improving productivity and efficiency in farm operations; and
(v) National Horticulture Mission aims at horticulture diversification.
This will also include the initiative on saffron.
National Mission for Protein Supplement
78. Mission for Protein Supplement is being strengthened. To improve
productivity in the dairy sector, a `2,242 crore project is being launched with
World Bank assistance. To broaden the scope of production of fish to coastal
aquaculture, apart from fresh water aquaculture, the outlay in 2012-13 is being
stepped up to `500 crore. Suitable allocations are also being made for poultry,
piggery and goat rearing.
Agriculture Credit
79. Farmers need timely access to affordable credit. I propose to raise the
target for agricultural credit in 2012-13 to `5,75,000 crore. This represents an
increase of ` 1,00,000 crore over the target for the current year.
80. The interest subvention scheme for providing short term crop loans to
farmers at 7 per cent interest per annum will be continued in 2012-13. An
additional subvention of 3 per cent will be available to prompt paying farmers.
In addition, the same interest subvention on post harvest loans up to six months
against negotiable warehouse receipt will also be available. This will encourage
the farmers to keep their produce in warehouses.
81. A Short term RRB Credit Refinance Fund is being set-up to enhance the
capacity of Regional Rural Banks to disburse short term crop loans to the small
http://indiabudget.nic.in
15
and marginal farmers. I propose to allocate ` 10,000 crore to NABARD for
refinancing the RRBs through this fund.
82. Kisan Credit Card (KCC) is an effective instrument for making
agricultural credit available to the farmers. KCC scheme will be modified to
make KCC a smart card which could be used at ATMs.
Agricultural Research
83. Food security and agricultural development in the coming decades would
depend upon scientific and technological breakthroughs in raising productivity.
We have to develop plant and seed varieties that yield more and can resist climate
change. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 200 crore for incentivising research
with rewards, both for institutions and the research team responsible for such
scientific breakthroughs.
Irrigation
84. Unless we recognise water as a resource, the day is not far when water
stress will start threatening our agricultural production. Focus on micro irrigation
schemes to dovetail these with water harvesting schemes is necessary. To maximise
the flow of benefits from investments in irrigation projects, structural changes in
Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) are being made. The allocation
for AIBP in 2012-13 is being stepped up by 13 per cent to `14,242 crore.
85. To mobilise large resources to fund irrigation projects, a Government
owned Irrigation and Water Resource Finance Company is being operationalised.
The Company would start its operations in 2012-13 by focusing on financing
sub-sectors like micro-irrigation, contract farming, waste water management and
sanitation.
86. A flood management project for Kandi sub-division of Murshidabad
District has been approved by the Ganga Flood Control Commission at a cost
of ` 439 crore, to be taken up for funding under the Flood Management
Programme.
National Mission on Food Processing
87. The food processing sector has been growing at an average rate of over 8
per cent over the past 5 years. In order to have a better outreach and to provide
more flexibility to suit local needs, it has been decided that a new centrally
sponsored scheme titled “National Mission on Food Processing” would be started,
in cooperation with the State Governments in 2012-13.
88. The Government has taken steps to create additional foodgrain storage
capacity in the country. Creation of 2 million tonnes of storage capacity in the
form of modern silos has already been approved. Nearly 15 million tonnes capacity
is being created under the Private Entrepreneur’s Guarantee Scheme, of which 3
million tonnes of storage capacity will be added by the end of 2011-12 and 5
million would be added next year.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
16
V. Inclusion
Let me now take up proposals for inclusive development.
Scheduled Castes and Tribal Sub Plans
89. From the year 2011-12, allocations are being made for Scheduled Castes
Sub Plan (SCSP) and Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) under separate minor heads as part of
the Plan allocations. In 2012-13, the allocation for SCSP is `37,113 crore which
represents an increase of 18 per cent over 2011-12. The allocation for TSP in
2012-13 is `21,710 crore representing an increase of 17.6 per cent over 2011-12.
Food Security
90. Our Government has taken definite steps to create food security at the
household level by making food a legal entitlement for all targeted people,
especially for the poor and vulnerable segments of our population. The National
Food Security Bill, 2011 is before the Parliamentary Standing Committee.
91. To ensure that the objectives of the National Food Security Bill are
effectively realised, a Public Distribution System Network is being created using
the Aadhaar platform. A National Information Utility for the computerisation of
PDS is being created. It will become operational by December 2012.
Multi-sectoral Nutrition Augmentation Programme
92. Following the decision taken in the Prime Minister’s National Council
on India’s Nutritional Challenges, a multi-sectoral programme to address maternal
and child malnutrition in selected 200 high burden districts is being rolled out
during 2012-13. It will harness synergies across nutrition, sanitation, drinking
water, primary health care, women education, food security and consumer
protection schemes.
93. In this context, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme
is being strengthened and re-structured. For 2012-13, an allocation of `15,850
crore has been made as against `10,000 crore in 2011-12. This amounts to an
increase of over 58 per cent.
94. National Programme of Mid Day Meals in Schools has enhanced
enrolment, retention, attendance, and also helped in improving nutrition levels
among children. In 2012-13, I propose to allocate `11,937 crore for this scheme
as against `10,380 crore in 2011-12.
95. Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls, SABLA,
has been introduced last year with a view to address the nutritional needs and
other educational and skill development initiatives for self development of
adolescent girls in the age group of 11 to 18 years. For 2012-13, an allocation of
`750 crore has been proposed for the scheme.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
17
Rural Development and Panchayati Raj
96. Along with water quality, poor sanitation is one of the factors contributing
to malnourishment. Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that I propose to
increase the budgetary allocation for rural drinking water and sanitation from
`11,000 crore in 2011-12 to `14,000 crore in 2012-13. This is an increase of
over 27 per cent.
97. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has been a successful
programme. In 2012-13, I propose to raise the allocation by 20 per cent to this
scheme by providing `24,000 crore. It will accelerate connectivity in the States.
98. A major initiative has been proposed to strengthen Panchayats across the
country through the Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA).
This programme will expand on the existing schemes for Panchayat capacity
building.
99. In my Budget Speech last year, I had referred to our focus on the
development of backward regions. We have decided to carry the Backward
Regions Grant Fund scheme into the Twelfth Plan with an enhanced allocation
of `12,040 crore in 2012-13, an increase of about 22 per cent over BE of
2011-12. This includes the State component which covers projects in backward
areas in Bihar, West Bengal and the Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region of
Odisha, development projects for drought mitigation in the Bundelkhand region
and projects under the Integrated Action Plan to accelerate the pace of
development in selected tribal and backward districts.
Rural Infrastructure Development Fund
100. This year, I propose to enhance the allocation under Rural Infrastructure
Development Fund (RIDF) to ` 20,000 crore. Further in view of the warehousing
shortage in the country, I propose to earmark an amount of ` 5,000 crore from
the above allocation exclusively for creating warehousing facilities under RIDF.
Education
101. The Right to Education (RTE) Act is being implemented with effect from
April 1, 2010 through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). For 2012-13, I have
provided `25,555 crore for RTE-SSA. This is an increase of 21.7 per cent over
2011-12.
102. In the Twelfth Plan, 6,000 schools have been proposed to be set up at
block level as model schools to benchmark excellence. Of these, 2500 will be
set up under Public Private Partnership.
103. The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) was launched in
March, 2009 to enhance access to quality secondary education. In 2012-13,
I have allocated `3,124 crore for RMSA which is nearly 29 per cent higher than
the allocation in 2011-12.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
18
104. A scheme for education loans is being implemented by banks. To ensure
better flow of credit to deserving students, I propose to set up a Credit Guarantee
Fund for this purpose.
Health
105. They say persistence pays. I am happy to inform Hon’ble Members that
no new case of polio was reported in the last one year. By modernising existing
units and setting up a new integrated vaccine unit near Chennai, the Government
will achieve vaccine security and keep the pressure on disease eradication and
prevention.
106. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) is being implemented through
‘Accredited Social Health Activist’- ‘ASHA’. The scope of ASHA’s activities is
being enlarged to include prevention of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, ensure 100
per cent immunisation and better spacing of children. At the community level, a
more active role is envisaged for ASHA as the convenor of the Village Health
and Sanitation Committee, as also to support the initiative on malnutrition. Since
ASHAs receive activity-wise, performance-based payments, this will also enhance
their remuneration. I propose to increase the allocation to NRHM from `18,115
crore in 2011-12 to `20,822 crore in 2012-13.
107. National Urban Health Mission is being launched to encompass the
primary healthcare needs of people in the urban areas. The Pradhan Mantri
Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) aimed at setting up of AIIMS-like
institutions and upgradation of existing Government medical colleges is being
expanded to cover upgradation of 7 more Government medical colleges. It will
enhance the availability of affordable tertiary health care.
Employment and Skill Development
108. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
(MGNREGS) has had a positive impact on livelihood security. For the first time,
there is an effective floor wage rate for rural workers. Distress migration has
come down. Community assets have been created. Productivity of barren and
fallow lands has gone up. The need for improving quality of assets and bringing
about greater synergy between MG-NREGA and agriculture and allied rural
livelihoods is being addressed.
109. The Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) has been restructured
into National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to provide self-employment
opportunities. A sub-component, Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana, under
NRLM seeks to provide better targeting of women farmers. For NRLM, I propose
to increase the allocation by over 34 per cent from `2,914 crore in 2011-12 to
`3,915 crore in 2012-13.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
19
110. In last year’s Budget I had announced creation of a ‘Women’s SHG’s
Development Fund’. This has been set up in NABARD. In 2012-13, I propose to
provide ` 200 crore to enlarge the corpus to ` 300 crore. This Fund will also
support the objectives of Aajeevika i.e. the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
It will empower women SHGs to access bank credit. I propose to provide interest
subvention to Women SHGs to avail loans up to `3 lakh at 7 per cent per annum.
Women SHGs that repay loans in time will get additional 3 per cent subvention,
reducing the effective rate to 4 per cent. The initiative, in the first phase, would
focus on selected 600 Blocks of 150 districts, including the Left Wing Extremism
affected districts.
111. It is proposed to establish a Bharat Livelihoods Foundation of India
through Aajeevika. The Foundation would support and scale up civil society
initiatives and interventions particularly in the tribal regions covering around
170 districts. Private trusts and philanthropic organisations would be encouraged
to partner with the autonomous body that will be managed professionally.
112. To encourage micro enterprises, a credit linked subsidy programme
namely Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) is being
implemented through KVIC. The allocation for this programme has been
increased by 23 per cent from `1,037 crore in 2011-12 to `1,276 crore in
2012-13.
Skill Development
113. In 2011-12 National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) approved
26 new projects, thereby doubling the number of projects sanctioned since 2009
to 52, with a total funding commitment of ` 1,205 crore. At the end of 10 years,
these projects are expected to train 6.2 crore persons and augment vocational
training capacity by 1.25 crore per year in the private sector.
114. The NSDC partners have opened 496 permanent and 2429 mobile centres
in 220 districts across 24 states. More than 89,500 persons have been trained
and almost 80 per cent employed. Under NSDC, 10 Sector Skill Councils have
been sanctioned. Of these, 3 Skill Councils for Automobile, Security and Retail
sectors have become operational. For 2012-13, I propose to allocate ` 1000 crore
to National Skill Development Fund (NSDF).
115. In order to improve the flow of institutional credit for skill development,
I propose to set up separate Credit Guarantee Fund. This will benefit youth in
acquiring market oriented skills.
116. A new scheme titled “Himayat” was introduced in Jammu and Kashmir
from 2011-12. It aims to provide skill training to one lakh youth in the next five
years. The entire cost of this programme is being borne by the Centre.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
20
Social security and the needs of weaker sections
117. I am raising the allocation under the National Social Assistance
Programme (NSAP) by 37 per cent from ` 6,158 crore in 2011-12 to ` 8,447
crore in 2012-13. Under the ongoing Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension
Scheme and Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme for BPL
beneficiaries, the monthly pension amount per person is being raised from ` 200
to ` 300.
118. On the death of the primary breadwinner of a BPL family, in the age
group 18 to 64 years, a lumpsum grant of `10,000 is presently provided under
the National Family Benefit scheme. I propose to double this amount to ` 20,000
and expect a matching contribution by the State Governments.
119. In order to promote voluntary savings towards pensions, a co-contributory
scheme SWAVALAMBAN was started in September, 2010. Over 5 lakh
subscribers have been enrolled by February 2012. In order to enhance access to
this scheme, LIC has been appointed as an Aggregator and all Public Sector
Banks have also been appointed as Points of Presence (PoP) and Aggregators.
Institutions that are being given grants
120. The driving force of a modern nation is research and the creation of new
knowledge. With this in mind I propose to provide:
• ` 25 crore to the Institute of Rural Management, Anand;
• ` 50 crore to establish a world-class centre for water quality with
focus on arsenic contamination in Kolkata;
• ` 100 crore to Kerala Agricultural University;
• ` 50 crore for University of Agricultural Sciences Dharwad,
Karnataka;
• ` 50 crore to Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural
University, Hissar;
• ` 50 crore to Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology;
• ` 100 crore to Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University in
Hyderabad;
• ` 15 crore to National Council for Applied Economic Research;
• ` 10 crore to Rajiv Gandhi University, Department of Economics,
Itanagar; and
• ` 10 crore to Siddharth Vihar Trust Gulbarga, to establish a Pali
language Research Centre.
Security
121. In the Budget for 2012-13, a provision of ` 1,93,407 crore has been made
for Defence Services which include `79,579 crore for capital expenditure. As
always, this allocation is based on present needs and any further requirement
would be met.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
21
122. Government is making efforts to increase the availability of residential
quarters to forces. In 2012-13, it is envisaged to construct nearly 4,000 residential
quarters for Central Armed Police Forces for which ` 1,185 crore is proposed to
be allocated. A provision of ` 3,280 crore for 2012-13 has also been made for
construction of office buildings including land acquisition and barracks to
accommodate 27,000 personnel.
123. The scheme to create the National Population Register (NPR) is
progressing well. It is likely to be completed within the next two years. The
Government is also considering a proposal of issuing Resident Identity Cards
bearing the Aadhaar numbers to all residents who are of age 18 years and above
to help in the e-governance initiatives.
VI. Governance
I now address some concerns in governance.
UID-Aadhaar
124. The enrolments into the Aadhaar system have crossed 20 crore and the
Aadhaar numbers generated upto date have crossed 14 crore. I propose to allocate
adequate funds to complete another 40 crore enrolments starting from
April 1, 2012. The Aadhaar platform is now ready to support the payments of
MG-NREGA; old age, widow and disability pensions; and scholarships directly
to the beneficiary accounts in selected areas.
Black Money
125. Last year I had outlined a five pronged strategy to tackle the malaise of
generation and circulation of black money and its illegitimate transfer outside
India. Government has taken a number of proactive steps to implement this
strategy. As a result:
• 82 Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) and 17 Tax
Information Exchange Agreements (TIEA) have been finalised and
information regarding bank accounts and assets held by Indians
abroad has started flowing in. In some cases prosecution will be
initiated;
• Dedicated exchange of information cell for speedy exchange of
tax information with treaty countries is fully functional in CBDT;
• India became the 33rd signatory of the Multilateral Convention on
Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters; and
• Directorate of Income Tax Criminal Investigation has been
established in CBDT.
126. I propose to lay on the table of the House a white paper on Black Money
in the current session of Parliament.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
22
Public Procurement Legislation
127. Government is committed to the enactment of a Public Procurement
legislation to enhance confidence in public procurement and to ensure
transparency and efficiency in the process. The Bill in this regard is to be
introduced in the Budget session of the Parliament.
128. The following legislative measures for strengthening anti-corruption
framework are in various stages of enactment:
• Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, 2011
introduced in Parliament with a view to bring certain provisions of
the Act in line with global standards;
• Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill, 2011 is currently being
examined by the Standing Committee on Finance. It would replace
the ‘Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988’; and
• National Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Bill,
2011 introduced in Parliament with a view to strengthen legal
provisions for implementation of the national policy on Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.
VII. Budget Estimates 2012-13
I now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2012-13.
129. The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at ` 10,77,612 crore which is an
increase of 15.6 per cent over the Budget Estimates and 19.5 per cent over the
Revised Estimates for 2011-12. As a percentage of GDP, gross taxes are estimated
at 10.6 per cent in BE 2012-13 as against 10.4 per cent in BE 2011-12. After
devolution to States, the net tax to Centre in 2012-13 is estimated at ` 7,71,071
crore. The Non Tax Revenue Receipts for 2012-13 are estimated at ` 1,64,614
crore and Non-debt Capital Receipts at ` 41,650 crore. The temporary arrangement
to use disinvestment proceeds for capital expenditure in social sector schemes is
being extended for one more year to 2012-13.
130. The total expenditure for 2012-13 is budgeted at ` 14,90,925 crore. Of
this, the Plan Expenditure for 2012-13 is ` 5,21,025 crore, which is 18 per cent
higher than the Budget Estimates of 2011-12. This is higher than the 15 per cent
increase projected in the Approach to the Twelfth Plan for 2012-13. I am happy
to inform the Hon’ble Members that in the Eleventh Plan, we have been able to
meet 99 per cent of the total plan outlay.
131. The Non Plan Expenditure for 2012-13 is budgeted at ` 9,69,900 crore
which is 8.7 per cent higher than the Revised Estimates for 2011-12 and 18.8
per cent higher than the Budget Estimates for 2011-12. This increase is mainly
http://indiabudget.nic.in
23
on account of higher provision for major subsidies. While making adequate
provisions for funding the desirable subsidies, as indicated earlier, I am
determined to contain the increasing subsidy burden through measures including
improved targeting.
132. The Plan and Non Plan resources transferred to States and Union
Territories including direct transfers to State and district level implementing
agencies are ` 3,65,216 crore in BE 2012-13. This includes ` 18,655 crore of
grant to local bodies as per the recommendations of Thirteenth Finance
Commission.
133. The year 2011-12 was one of challenges for fiscal management. Due to
the slower economic growth, direct tax collection fell short by ` 32,000 crore of
the Budget Estimates. At the same time, the Government absorbed duty reduction
in petroleum sector with annual revenue loss of ` 49,000 crore. The Government
had to incur higher expenditure on petroleum and fertiliser subsidy to insulate
the people from the rising prices. While the outgo on account of subsidies
increased, I have ensured that the entire amount is given in cash and not as bonds
in lieu of subsidies. This is in line with the approach that I outlined in my Budget
Speech for 2010-11.
134. The combined effect of lower tax and disinvestment receipts and higher
expenditure, mainly on account of subsidies, has pushed the fiscal deficit to 5.9
per cent of GDP in the Revised Estimates for 2011-12. However, I have made a
determined attempt to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation in the Budget
for 2012-13 by pegging the fiscal deficit at ` 5,13,590 crore which is 5.1 per cent
of GDP. After taking into account other items of financing, the net market
borrowings through dated securities to finance this deficit is ` 4.79 lakh crore.
With this, the total Debt stock at the end of 2012-13 would work out at 45.5 per
cent of GDP as compared to the Thirteenth Finance Commission target of 50.5
per cent of GDP. The Effective Revenue Deficit in BE 2012-13 works out to
` 1,85,752 crore which is 1.8 per cent of GDP.

Part B
VIII. Tax Proposals
Madam Speaker,
I now come to Part B of my proposals.
135. The life of a Finance Minister is not easy. Various players, including
policy makers, politicians, agriculturists and business houses, participate in the
making of the economy. When everything goes well with the economy, we all
share in the joy. However, when things go wrong, it is the Finance Minister who
is called upon to administer the medicine. Economic policy, as in medical
treatment, often requires us to do something, which, in the short run, may be
painful, but is good for us in the long run. As Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark,
had said in Shakespeare’s immortal words, “I must be cruel only to be kind.”
With this reminder, let me now turn to the tax proposals.
136. Last year, I had set the compass for movement towards the DTC in Direct
Taxes and GST in Indirect Taxes. My tax proposals for fiscal year 2012-13 mark
further progress in that direction.
Direct Taxes
I shall now deal with direct taxes.
137. Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by enhancing the
exemption limit as a move towards DTC rates. Although DTC will not be
effective from this year, I propose to introduce the DTC rates for personal income
tax. I propose to enhance the exemption limit for the general category of
individual taxpayers from `1,80,000 to `2,00,000. This measure will provide
tax relief upto `2,000 to every taxpayer of this category. I also propose to raise
the upper limit of the 20 per cent tax slab from `8 lakh to `10 lakh. The proposed
personal income tax slabs are:
Income upto `2 lakh Nil
Income above `2 lakh and upto `5 lakh 10 per cent
Income above `5 lakh and upto `10 lakh 20 per cent
Income above `10 lakh 30 per cent
These changes will provide substantial relief to taxpayers.
138. I propose to allow individual taxpayers, a deduction of upto `10,000
for interest from savings bank accounts. This would help a large number of
small taxpayers with salary incomes upto `5 lakh and interest from savings
bank accounts up to ` 10,000, as they would not be required to file income tax
returns.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
25
139. Within the existing limit for deduction allowed for health insurance,
I propose to allow a deduction of upto `5,000 for preventive health check-up.
140. Senior citizens who do not have any income from business are proposed
to be exempted from the payment of advance tax. This will reduce their
compliance burden.
141. In the case of corporates, I am not proposing any change in the tax rates.
However, I propose certain measures to allow corporates to access lower cost
funds and to promote higher level of investments in several sectors.
142. In order to provide low cost funds to some stressed infrastructure sectors,
the rate of withholding tax on interest payments on external commercial
borrowings is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 5 per cent for three
years. These sectors are:
• power;
• airlines;
• roads and bridges;
• ports and shipyards;
• affordable housing;
• fertilizer; and
• dams
143. The restriction on Venture Capital Funds to invest only in nine specified
sectors is proposed to be removed. It is further proposed to remove the cascading
effect of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) in a multi-tier corporate structure. I
also propose to continue to allow repatriation of dividends from foreign
subsidiaries of Indian companies to India at a lower tax rate of 15 per cent as
against the tax rate of 30 per cent for one more year i.e. upto March 31, 2013.
144. Investment linked deduction of capital expenditure incurred in the
following businesses is proposed to be provided at the enhanced rate of 150 per
cent, as against the current rate of 100 per cent.
• Cold chain facility
• Warehouses for storage of food grains
• Hospitals
• Fertilisers
• Affordable housing
145. The following new sectors are proposed to be added for the purposes of
investment linked deduction:
• bee keeping and production of honey and beeswax
• container freight station and inland container depots
• warehousing for storage of sugar
http://indiabudget.nic.in
26
146. To promote investment in research and development, it is proposed to
extend the weighted deduction of 200 per cent for R&D expenditure in an
in-house facility beyond March 31, 2012 for a further period of five years.
147. I also propose to provide weighted deduction of 150 per cent on
expenditure incurred for agri-extension services in order to facilitate growth in
the agriculture sector.
148. For the power sector, besides access to low cost funds as outlined above,
I also propose extension of the sunset date by one year for power sector
undertakings so that they can be set up on or before March 31, 2013 for claiming
100 per cent deduction of profits for 10 years. Additional depreciation of 20 per
cent in the initial year is proposed to be extended to new assets acquired by
power generation companies.
149. For SMEs, the turnover limit for compulsory tax audit of accounts as
well as for presumptive taxation is proposed to be raised from `60 lakh to
` 1 crore.
150. In order to augment funds for SMEs, I propose to exempt capital gains
tax on sale of a residential property, if the sale consideration is used for
subscription in equity of a manufacturing SME company for purchase of new
plant and machinery.
151. Considering the shortage of skilled manpower in the manufacturing sector
and to generate employment, I propose to provide weighted deduction at the rate
of 150 per cent of expenditure incurred on skill development in manufacturing
sector in accordance with specified guidelines.
152. In order to reduce transaction costs in the capital markets, I propose
reduction in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) by 20 per cent (from 0.125 per
cent to 0.1 per cent) on cash delivery transactions.
153. In order to moderate the outgo on profit linked deductions, I propose to
extend the levy of Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) on all persons other than
companies, claiming profit linked deductions.
154. I propose to introduce a General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) in order
to counter aggressive tax avoidance schemes, while ensuring that it is used only
in appropriate cases, by enabling a review by a GAAR panel.
155. I propose a series of measures to deter the generation and use of
unaccounted money. To this end, I propose
• Introduction of compulsory reporting requirement in case of assets
held abroad.
• Allowing for reopening of assessment upto 16 years in relation to
assets held abroad.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
27
• Tax collection at source on purchase in cash of bullion or jewellery
in excess of ` 2 lakh.
• Tax deduction at source on transfer of immovable property (other
than agricultural land) above a specified threshold.
• Tax collection at source on trading in coal, lignite and iron ore.
• Increasing the onus of proof on closely held companies for funds
received from shareholders as well as taxing share premium in
excess of fair market value.
• Taxation of unexplained money, credits, investments, expenditures
etc., at the highest rate of 30 per cent irrespective of the slab of
income.
156. My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue
loss of ` 4500 crore for the year.
Indirect Taxes
157. I shall now turn to indirect taxes. In a slight departure from the previous
years, I shall begin with Service Tax.
Service Tax
158. At the end of June this year, this tax will attain adulthood by completing
18 years. It is therefore time to shift gears and accelerate ahead. However, service
tax needs to confront two important challenges to sustain the journey. These are:
• The share of services in taxes remains far below its potential.
There is a need to widen the tax base and strengthen its
enforcement;
• Service Tax law is complex and sometimes avoidably different
from Central Excise. We need to bring the two as close as possible
in the light of our eventual goal of transition to GST.
I have attempted to address both these issues this year.
159. Last year, I had initiated a public debate on the desirability of moving
towards taxation of services based on a negative list. In the debate that continued
for the better part of the year, we received overwhelming support for this new
concept. It has been perceived both as sound economics and prudent fiscal
management.
160. Thus, I propose to tax all services except those in the negative list. The
list comprises 17 heads and has been carefully drawn up, keeping in view the
federal nature of our polity, the best international practices and our socio-economic
requirements.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
28
161. The important inclusions in the negative list comprise all services provided
by the government or local authorities, except a few specified services where they
compete with private sector. The list also includes pre-school and school education,
recognised education at higher levels and approved vocational education, renting
of residential dwellings, entertainment and amusement services and a large part of
public transportation including inland waterways, urban railways and metered cabs.
162. Agriculture and animal husbandry enjoy a very important place in our
lives. Practically all services required for cultivation, breeding, production,
processing or marketing up to the stage the produce is sold in the primary markets
are covered by the list.
163. In addition to the negative list, there is a list of exemptions which include
health care, services provided by charities, religious persons, sportspersons,
performing artists in folk and classical arts, individual advocates providing
services to non-business entities, independent journalists, and services by way
of animal care or car parking.
164. To take financial services to the door steps in rural areas, I have also
exempted the services of business facilitators and correspondents to banks and
insurance companies.
165. Construction services relating to specified infrastructure, canals, irrigation
works, post-harvest infrastructure, residential dwelling, and low-cost mass
housing up to an area of 60 sq. mtr. under the Scheme of Affordable Housing in
Partnership are also included in the exemptions. To make the life of those who
already own an apartment a little easier, I propose to raise the exemption for the
monthly charges payable by a member to a housing society from ` 3,000 to
`5,000.
166. The Year 2012 marks the beginning of the centenary year of Indian cinema.
Despite the change in titles from Dada Saheb Phalke’s “Raja Harishchandra” to
“Ra. One” in recent times, the industry has played a pivotal role in unifying our
country in the wake of her considerable diversity. To add to their spirit of
celebration, I propose to exempt the industry from service tax on copyrights
relating to recording of cinematographic films.
167. Movement towards the negative list will result in reducing nearly 290
definitions and descriptions in the Act to 54, and the exemptions from the existing
88 to 10, of course merging some of the existing exemptions into a revised
notification. In terms of number of pages, the law will be shorter by nearly 40
per cent.
168. As a measure of harmonisation between Central Excise and Service Tax,
a number of alignments have been made. These include a common simplified
registration form and a common return for Central Excise and Service Tax, to be
named EST-1. This common return will comprise only one page, which will be
a significant reduction from the 15 pages of the two returns at present.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
29
169. Revision Application Authority and Settlement Commission are being
introduced in Service Tax to help resolve disputes with far greater ease.
170. Cascading of taxes has been significantly reduced by permitting utilisation
of input tax credits in a number of services such as catering, restaurants, hotel
accommodation, pandal and shamiana and transport sectors.
171. Place of Supply Rules, that will determine the location where a service
shall be deemed to be provided, are being placed in public domain for
stakeholders’ comments and shall be notified when the negative list is put into
effect. These rules will also provide a possible backdrop to initiate an informed
debate to assess all the issues that may arise in the taxation of inter-state services
for the eventual launch of GST.
172. I propose to set up a Study Team to examine the possibility of a common
tax code for service tax and central excise which could be adopted to harmonise
the two legislations as much as possible at the right time.
173. While the problems faced by exporters of goods with respect to taxes on
input services was addressed earlier this year, disbursement of taxes that go into
the export of services has been an irritant for long. I now announce a new scheme
that will simplify refunds without resorting to voluminous documentation or
verification. As an added incentive, such refunds will also be admissible for
taxes on taxable services that have been exempted.
174. Rules pertaining to the Point of Taxation are also being rationalised,
providing greater clarity and removing the irritants. Cenvat credits in a number
of areas are being restored. There are a number of other proposals both for the
facilitation of business and to check malpractices. I do not wish to take the valuable
time of this House for discussing all these proposals.
175. You will notice that most of these measures are guided by the need to
move towards a system that is simple, equitable and progressive but are unlikely
to make the exchequer richer in any significant way. Looking at our vast
commitments and to maintain a healthy fiscal situation, I propose to raise the
service tax rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, with consequential changes in
rates for services that have individual tax rates.
176. My proposals from service tax are expected to yield an additional revenue
of ` 18,660 crore. Keeping in mind that the share of services in GDP is 59 per
cent, you would agree that the proposed increase is not too harsh.
I shall now deal with proposals relating to the other indirect taxes.
177. In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008-09, the standard rate of
excise duty for non-petroleum goods was reduced from 14 per cent to 8 per cent
in a phased manner. This rate was raised from 8 per cent to 10 per cent in Budget
http://indiabudget.nic.in
30
2010-11. Given the imperative for fiscal correction, I propose to now raise the
standard rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, the merit rate from 5 per cent to 6
per cent, and the lower merit rate from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. However, the
lower merit rate for coal, fertilisers, mobile phones and precious metal jewellery
is being retained at 1 per cent.
178. Large cars currently attract excise duty depending on their engine capacity
and length. In keeping with the increase proposed in the standard rate, I propose
to enhance the duty from 22 per cent to 24 per cent. In the case of cars that attract
a mixed rate of duty of 22 per cent + `15000 per vehicle, I propose to increase
the duty and switch over to an ad valorem rate of 27 per cent.
179. No change is proposed in the peak rate of customs duty of 10 per cent on
non-agricultural goods. Barring a few individual items, the rates below the peak
are also being retained.
180. I shall now take up relief proposals for specific sectors – especially those
under stress. These have been formulated to stimulate investment and
manufacturing growth.
Agriculture & Related Sectors
181. Carrying forward the initiatives taken for agriculture and agro-processing
in the previous Budgets, I propose:
• to reduce basic customs duty from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent on:
 sugarcane planter, root or tuber crop harvesting machine and
rotary tiller and weeder;
 parts for the manufacture of these;
• to reduce basic customs duty from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent on
specified coffee plantation and processing machinery;
• to extend project import benefit to green house and protected
cultivation for horticulture and floriculture at concessional basic
customs duty of 5 per cent;
• to reduce basic customs duty on some water soluble fertilisers and
liquid fertilisers, other than urea, from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent
and from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent;
• to extend concessional import duty available for installation of
Mechanised Handling Systems and Pallet Racking Systems in
mandis or warehouses for horticultural produce.
182. Imports of equipment for initial setting up or substantial expansion of
fertiliser projects are being fully exempted from basic customs duty of 5 per cent
for a period of three years up to March 31, 2015.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
31
Infrastructure
183. In the realm of infrastructure my proposals address some weaknesses in
the troika of power, coal and railways.
184. Domestic producers of thermal power have been under stress because of
high prices of coal. I propose to ease the situation by providing full exemption
from basic customs duty and a concessional CVD of 1 per cent to Steam coal for
a period of two years till March 31, 2014. Full exemption from basic duty is also
being provided to the following fuels for power generation:
• Natural Gas and Liquified Natural Gas; and
• Uranium concentrate, Sintered Uranium Dioxide in natural and
pellet form.
Mining
185. Better surveying and prospecting for minerals are essential for improving
the productivity and efficiency of our mining sector. I propose to reduce basic
customs duty on machinery and instruments for surveying and prospecting from
10 per cent or 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. In addition, full exemption from basic
customs duty is being provided to coal mining projects.
Railways
186. Over the next five years, Indian Railways are undertaking two major
projects for passenger safety and better service delivery. These are - the installation
of Train Protection and Warning System and upgradation of track structure for
high speed trains. I propose to reduce basic customs duty on equipment required
for their implementation from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Roads
187. Full exemption from import duty on specified equipment imported for
road construction by contractors of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways,
NHAI and State Governments is being extended to contracts awarded by
Metropolitan Development Authorities.
188. Tunnel boring machines and parts for their assembly are covered by
this exemption. I propose to allow their import free of duty without end-use
condition.
Civil Aviation
189. India has potential for establishing itself as a hub for third-party
Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) of civilian aircraft. To actualize this
potential, I propose to fully exempt from basic customs duty parts of aircraft and
testing equipment imported for this purpose. As a measure of support to the
airline industry, it is also proposed to fully exempt both new and retreaded aircraft
tyres from basic customs duty and excise duty.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
32
Manufacturing
190. My proposals for the manufacturing sector that needs support at this
juncture, seek to provide relief through cost reduction of raw materials, inputs,
components and capital goods.
191. To encourage enrichment of low-grade iron ore, of which we have huge
reserves, I propose to reduce basic customs duty on plant and machinery imported
for setting up or substantial expansion of iron ore pellet plants or iron ore
beneficiation plants from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. My other proposals relating
to the steel sector are as under:
• to reduce basic customs duty on:
 coating material for manufacture of electrical steel from 7.5
per cent to 5 per cent
 nickel ore and concentrate and nickel oxide/ hydroxide from
2.5 per cent or 7.5 per cent to Nil
• to enhance export duty on chromium ore from `3000 per tonne to
30 per cent ad valorem
• to enhance basic customs duty on non-alloy, flat-rolled steel from
5 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
192. Our textile industry, especially the weaving sector, urgently needs to
modernise. I propose to fully exempt automatic shuttle-less looms from basic
customs duty of 5 per cent. Similarly, full exemption from basic duty is being
accorded to automatic silk reeling and processing machinery as well as its parts.
It is also proposed to restrict these exemptions and the existing concessional rate
of basic customs duty of 5 per cent only to new textile machinery. Second-hand
machinery would now attract basic duty of 7.5 per cent. Other proposals on
textiles are:
• to reduce basic customs duty on wool waste and wool tops from
15 per cent to 5 per cent
• to reduce basic customs duty on Titanium dioxide from 10 per
cent to 7.5 per cent
• to extend full exemption from basic customs duty to aramid yarn
and fabric used for the manufacture of bullet proof helmets
193. Excise duty of 10 per cent is applicable to branded ready-made garments
with abatement of 55 per cent from the Retail Sale Price. Along with increase in
duty to 12 per cent, I propose to enhance the abatement to 70 per cent. As a
result, the incidence of duty as a percentage of the Retail Sale Price would come
down from 4.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent.
194. Our MSME sector is fertile ground for the production of low-cost medical
devices. In order to provide impetus to this sector, I propose to reduce basic
http://indiabudget.nic.in
33
customs duty to 2.5 per cent with concessional CVD of 6 per cent on specified
parts, components and raw materials for the manufacture of some disposables
and instruments. Full exemption from basic customs duty and CVD is also being
extended to specified raw materials for the manufacture of coronary stents and
heart valves. These concessions would be subject to actual user condition.
195. My other proposals to support the manufacturing sector include:
• Full exemption from basic customs duty on
 waste paper,
 LCD and LED TV panels, and parts of memory card for
mobile phones
• Reduction of basic customs duty on specified raw materials for the
manufacture of adult diapers from 10 per cent or 7.5 per cent to 5
per cent with CVD of 6 per cent and nil special CVD.
196. My attention has been drawn to the plight of a few sectors that are highly
labour-intensive and produce items of mass consumption. As a measure of
support, I propose to enhance basic customs duty on bicycles from 10 per cent to
30 per cent and on bicycle parts from 10 per cent to 20 per cent.
197. Full exemption from excise duty is currently available to hand-made
matches while others attract the standard rate. It is proposed to reduce excise
duty on matches manufactured by semi-mechanised units from 10 per cent to 6
per cent.
Health and Nutrition
198. It is proposed to extend concessional basic customs duty of 5 per cent
with full exemption from excise duty/CVD to six specified life-saving drugs/
vaccines. These are used for the treatment or prevention of ailments such as
HIV-AIDS, renal cancer, etc.
199. Protein deficiency among women and children is one of the most common
sources of malnutrition in India. I propose to reduce basic customs duty on Soya
protein concentrate and isolated soya protein from 30 per cent or 15 per cent
respectively to 10 per cent. Simultaneously, excise duty on all processed soya
food products is being reduced to the merit rate of 6 per cent.
200. Consumption of iodised salt prevents iodine deficiency and related
diseases. I propose to provide a concessional basic customs duty of 2.5 per cent
along with reduced excise duty of 6 per cent on iodine.
201. Probiotics are a cost-effective means of combating bacterial infections.
It is proposed to reduce the basic customs duty on this item from 10 per cent to
5 per cent.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
34
Environment
202. In order to fully realise our potential in the realm of solar energy, solar
thermal projects need encouragement. I propose to fully exempt plant and
equipment etc. for the initial setting up of such projects from special CVD.
203. Concessions have already been provided for encouraging the consumption
of energy-saving devices. I propose to fully exempt a coating chemical used for
compact fluorescent lamps, from basic customs duty. Excise duty on LED lamps
is also being reduced to 6 per cent.
204. Specified parts required for the manufacture of hybrid vehicles enjoy
full exemption from basic customs duty and special CVD with concessional
excise duty/ CVD of 6 per cent. This concession is being extended to specified
additional items and lithium ion batteries imported for the manufacture of battery
packs for supply to electric or hybrid vehicle manufacturers.
205. One of the primary drivers of the current account deficit has been the
growth of almost 50 per cent in imports of gold and other precious metals in the
first three quarters of this year. I have been advised to strengthen the steps
already taken to check this trend for better results. I propose to increase basic
customs duty on standard gold bars; gold coins of purity exceeding 99.5 per cent
and platinum from 2 per cent to 4 per cent and on non-standard gold from 5 per
cent to 10 per cent. In sync with these, basic duty on gold ore, concentrate and
dore bars for refining is being enhanced from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. On the
excise side, duty on refined gold is being increased in the same proportion from
1.5 per cent to 3 per cent.
206. In order to prevent round-tripping, it is proposed to impose basic customs
duty of 2 per cent on cut and polished, coloured gem stones at par with diamonds.
Additional Resource Mobilisation
207. I shall now take up my proposals on “demerit” goods. I propose to
increase basic excise duty on cigarettes of more than 65mm length by adding
an ad valorem component of 10 per cent to the existing specific rates. The ad
valorem duty would be chargeable on 50 per cent of the Retail Sale Price
declared on the pack.
208. I also propose to carry out a nominal increase in basic excise duty on
hand-rolled bidis from `8 to `10 per thousand and on machine-rolled bidis from
`19 to `21 per thousand. The existing exemption available to hand-rolled bidis
for clearances up to 20 lakh bidis per annum is being retained.
209. Pan masala, gutkha, chewing tobacco, unmanufactured tobacco and zarda
scented tobacco in pouches are leviable to excise duty under the compounded
levy scheme. The rates of duty specified per packing machine for these items are
being stepped up taking into account improvements in the efficiency of machines
used by this industry.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
35
210. Crude petroleum oil produced in India attracts a cess of `2,500 per metric
tonne under the Oil Industries Development Act. This rate was last revised in
Budget 2006-07. As a measure of indexation, I propose to increase the rate of
cess to `4,500 per metric tonne.
211. Completely Built Units of large cars/ MUVs/ SUVs having engine
capacity above a prescribed threshold and whose value exceeds US dollar 40,000
per vehicle are permitted for import without type approval. Basic customs duty
on such vehicles is being enhanced from 60 per cent to 75 per cent ad valorem.
Rationalisation Measures
212. Packaged cement, whether manufactured by mini-cement plants or others,
attracts differential excise duty depending on the Retail Sale Price per bag. It is
proposed to prescribe a unified rate of 12 per cent + `120 PMT for non-mini
cement plants and 6 per cent + `120 PMT for mini-cement plants. It is proposed
to charge this duty on the Retail Sale Price less abatement of 30 per cent.
213. The House would recall that I had re-introduced a levy of excise duty of
1 per cent on branded precious metal jewellery in the last Budget. As a measure
of rationalisation, I propose to include jewellery, not bearing a brand name, under
its ambit. However, to simplify its operation and minimise its impact on small
artisans and goldsmiths, I propose:
• to charge this duty on tariff value equal to 30 per cent of the
transaction value;
• to extend small-scale exemption up to annual turnover not
exceeding `1.5 crore for units having a turnover below ` 4 crore in
the previous year;
• to compute turnover on the basis of tariff value; and
• to place the onus of registration and payment on the person who
gets jewellery manufactured on job-work.
214. I propose to fully exempt branded silver jewellery from excise duty.
215. Building of commercial vehicle bodies is currently exempt from excise
duty. In lieu of this duty, a specific rate of `10,000 is being charged on chassis in
addition to the applicable ad valorem duty. This duty structure is regressive. It is
proposed to convert the specific component of duty to an ad valorem rate of 3
per cent.
216. In the last Budget, excise duty exemption on ships and vessels including
dredgers was withdrawn. Accordingly, CVD of 5 per cent became leviable on
their imports. As the intention was not to levy this duty on the import of foreign-
going vessels, I propose to exempt such vessels from CVD retrospectively.
http://indiabudget.nic.in
36
However, to ensure that ships, vessels and dredgers manufactured in India do
not face disability vis-à-vis foreign-going ships converting into coastal vessels,
necessary safeguard is being provided.
Baggage Allowance
217. Baggage allowance for Indians travelling abroad was last revised in 2004.
I propose to increase the duty-free allowance for eligible passengers of Indian
origin from `25,000 to `35,000 and for children of up to 10 years from `12,000
to `15,000.
218. My proposals relating to Customs and Central excise are estimated to
result in a net revenue gain of ` 27,280 crore for a full year.
219. My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue
loss of `4500 crore for the year. Proposals relating to Indirect Taxes are estimated
to result in a net revenue gain of `45,940 crore, leaving a net gain of `41,440
crore in the Budget.
220. For the Indian economy, this was a challenging year. A number of global
and domestic factors militated against the growth that had revived in the last two
years. But India has thrived under challenges and India will do so now. In the
middle of every crisis, there is also an opportunity. It is an opportunity to re-
think, re-assess and make way for new ideas and policies. It is in this spirit that
I approached the Budget of this year. The aim is to create an enabling atmosphere
for corporates, farmers, entrepreneurs and workers to take initiatives for robust
growth. The aim is also to ensure that the benefits of growth reach all sections of
population. India stands on the brink of a major resurgence. Whether or not
today’s announcements make tomorrow morning’s headlines matters little, as
long as they help in shaping the headlines that describe India a decade from now.
Madam Speaker, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House.
